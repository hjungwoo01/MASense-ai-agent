Additionally, either one of the two criteria must be met:

- If the activity in question is located in Singapore: Data centre must comply with BCA-IMDA Green Mark Scheme for New Data Centres for new Data Centres Platinum Rating criteria. The implementation of those practices is verified by an independent third-party and audited at least every three years. Re-certification has to be obtained every three years, or
- If the activity in question is located outside of Singapore: WUE of the new data centres should be no more than 2.1 if the project starts before 2025, 2.0 if the project starts after 2025.

| ISIC description | This class includes the writing, modifying, testing and supporting of software; designing the structure and content of, and/or writing the computer code necessary to create and implement systems software (including updates and patches), software applications (including updates and patches), databases and web pages; customising of software, i.e. modifying and configuring an existing application so that it is functional within the clients’ information system environment; planning and designing computer systems that integrate computer hardware, software and communication technologies; provision of on-site management and operation of clients’ computer systems and/or data processing facilities, as well as related support services. |

Amber The activity complies with all of the following criteria: Amber criteria are developed by Climate Bonds and modified throughout the discussions with the relevant experts during the consultation phase. PUE target are adapted from the Singaporean certification schemes.

- Retrofitting of existing facilities only
- For retrofitting that starts before 2025, PUE of the project should reference the latest version of the BCA-IMDA Green Mark Scheme for Existing Data Centres⁷³ – GOLD rating. If the retrofitting starts between 2025-2030, PUE of the project should reference the latest version of the BCA-IMDA Green Mark Scheme for Existing Data Centres – GoldPLUS rating.
- Project retrofitting must lead to aligning the existing Data Centre with a pathway of reaching PUE (at full capacity) green criteria from 2030, and
- The GWP of refrigerants used in the data centre cooling system must not exceed 675, or meet applicable national standards/regulations, whichever is lower.

Additionally, either one of the two criteria must be met:

- If the activity in question is located in Singapore: Data centre must comply with BCA-IMDA Green Mark Scheme for Existing Data Centres Gold plus Rating criteria, with recertification obtained every 3 years, or
- If the activity in question is located outside of Singapore: WUE of the retrofitted data centres should be no more than 2.3 at the beginning of the retrofitting and retrofit project must lead to aligning the existing data centre with a pathway of achieving at least 2.0 by 2030.

Ineligible

- Not compatible with either of the criteria

Ineligible

- N.A.

73The most updated scheme as of this current Taxonomy iteration is the BCA-IMDA Green Mark for Existing Data Centres (2019). For the Gold rating, PUE thresholds are: 1.6 at 25% IT load; 1.53 at 50% IT load; 1.45 at 75% IT load; 1.42 at 100% IT load. For the GoldPLUS rating, PUE thresholds are: 1.55 at 25% IT load; 1.49 at 50% IT load; 1.42 at 75% IT load; 1.39 at 100% IT load.
