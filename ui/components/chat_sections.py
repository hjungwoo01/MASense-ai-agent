### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Sustainability Compliance Assistant

This agent helps you classify your financial actions and disclosures under the **MAS Singapore-Asia Taxonomy**  
using the **traffic-light system**: **Green / Amber / Ineligible**. It also explains the rationale with citations and suggests next steps.

#### What you can do here
1. **Upload a PDF** (start with your latest **Sustainability/ESG Report**).  
   You can also add: project memos, green loan frameworks, term sheets, or portfolio holdings.
2. **Chat in plain English** to tell us your goals and context (e.g., *"We plan to refinance a 50MW solar farm in SG"*).
3. The agent classifies the activity and explains **why** (with taxonomy clause references),  
   and tells you what **data is missing** if any.

#### If you're unsure what to upload
- Start with your **Sustainability Report (PDF)** or **project/loan document** that covers:  
  - Sector & activity (e.g., Energy â†’ Solar PV; Buildings â†’ New Construction)  
  - Key metrics (e.g., **gCOâ‚‚e/kWh**, capture rate %, EPC certifications, timelines)  
  - Any **transition plan** details (targets, 2030 deadlines)
"""

TIPS_MD = """
**Good to have:**  
- Emissions intensity (Scope 1/2 relevant metrics), commissioning / retirement years  
- Evidence of DNSH (e.g., flood risk adaptation) and Minimum Social Safeguards (e.g., labor policies)  
- For loans: KPI/SPT details (for SLL) or Use-of-Proceeds (for Green Loans)
