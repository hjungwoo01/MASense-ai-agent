The SAT scopes in activities across eight sectors that are responsible for 90% of ASEAN’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and over 40% of ASEAN’s economic value-add. In addition, the SAT also includes an addendum covering managed coal phase-out, which aims to provide a credible standard to increase participation in projects for the early retirement of coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) that are aligned with a 1.5 degrees Celsius (1.5°C) decarbonisation pathway for the global power sector.",

Aligned with global standards, including the ICMA GBP, LMA GLP, it aligns to jurisdiction- specific taxonomies like the SAT.

It provides a structured approach in classifying transition finance in line with global standards and science-based taxonomies supporting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C/below 2°C goal. Recognising the differentiated pace of transition required across ASEAN nations, Maybank’s TFF undertakes a principled and pragmatic approach to transition finance transactions. Where national/regional pathways and taxonomies are present and are aligned to the temperature outcome of the Paris Agreement, the bank may choose to reference these taxonomies in determining if an activity can qualify for transition finance. This means that for assets booked in Singapore, the SAT serves as a key reference for evaluating transition finance eligibility. The TFF’s eligible transition activities for Steel Manufacturing, Natural Gas Transmission and Distribution, and International Aviation largely align with SAT’s green or amber categories, with some instances of stricter requirements in place.",

The Hydroglyder’s hydrofoil system lifts the hull above the water, significantly reducing drag and energy consumption. This innovative design results in up to 80% lower energy consumption and significantly lower operational costs compared to conventional vessels. Aligned with the green criteria under the Transportation sector in the SAT — vessels with zero direct tailpipe CO2 emissions, the Hydrogylder’s zero emission technology and energy-efficient design represent a key step towards advancing the maritime industry’s decarbonisation efforts.",
