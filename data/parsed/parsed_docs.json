    "text": "\nGuidance for everaging the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy in reen and Transition Financing\n\n# Executive summary\n\nThe structure of this guidance is as follows:\n\n# Part 1\n\n- Section 1 provides guidance on addressing data availability challenges, recognising situations in which specific data points needed to meet green or transition thresholds are not readily available.\n- Section 2 outlines the treatment of interim amber thresholds and sunset dates.\n- Section 3 establishes grandfathering provisions, applied as the TSC is revised.\n- Section 4 presents practical approaches for meeting entity-level transition plan requirements.\n- Section 5 clarifies the distinction between amber and amber (measures) to guide financiers in their practical applications.\n\n# Part 2\n\nThe guidance also provides early industry thinking on how financiers and borrowers can reference the SAT to recognise transition efforts. In these instances, financiers and borrowers may still explore transition financing under their respective sustainable or transition financing frameworks. It should be noted that such transactions will not be considered SAT-aligned.\n\n- Section 6 outlines how certain non-aligned financing instruments might qualify for transition financing through referencing the SAT, notwithstanding that the underlying assets or projects cannot fulfil all criteria under the SAT due to reasons beyond the borrower’s control, or where some criteria may not be fully relevant for the asset or project being financed.\n- Section 7 presents alternative approaches to address the limited commercial availability of carbon capture and storage (CCS); and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) solutions.\n- Section 8 provides guidance on transition financing for new assets not currently referenced in the SAT.\n\nWhile our guidance primarily focuses on transition, several sections1 offer guidance on applying SAT Technical Screening Criteria (TSC) for both green and transition activities.\n\n1The following sections apply to both green and transition activities: 1) Demonstrating alignment with the TSC in the absence of required data, 3) Grandfathering rules and provisions in the SAT, 6) Transition financing referencing the SAT where the projects do not meet all the TSC, and 9) Recognising enabling and value chain activities that support green and transition activities in the SAT.\n\n7\n",

These might include:\n\n1. Existing assets: Resource constraints or a lack of measured data points for existing assets (e.g., the borrower has not measured the lifecycle GHG emissions of its energy generation process).\n2. New assets: The asset is still in the design or construction phase, whereas the TSC requires operational data.\n3. Asset acquisition: The borrower is raising money to acquire an asset not under its management.\n4. Forward-looking TSC: The TSC apply to a future date.\n5. Value chain position: The borrower’s involvement is higher in the value chain, and it does not have control over downstream operational data to which the TSC applies.\n\nThe proxies used should take reference from internationally or nationally recognised databases that are deemed credible in the relevant sector(s). Such proxy data or documentary evidence may include lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) assessments, technical design specifications, sustainability certifications, feasibility studies, environmental impact assessments or other applicable technical reports.\n\nSSFA recommends these be independently reviewed, verified or audited by a reputable third party.

If G-RES data confirms that GHG emissions intensity levels meet the TSC for hydropower, the financier may rely on this to classify the financing as green.\n\nThe financier should request a commitment from the borrower to assess the plant’s operational data and alignment with the TSC following the acquisition. If the operational data does not meet the green or amber criteria, the financier should request a transition plan. In the absence of such a plan, the financier should declassify the financing instrument.\n\n# Scenario 2\n\nNew assets – The asset is still in the design or construction phase\n\nA borrower developing an extension (e.g., building of additional generation units) to an existing power plant will not have a technical assessment report at the point of financing. To demonstrate its commitment to the TSC, the borrower may produce a confirmation to the financier that the expansion will:\n\n- Adhere to the technical specifications of the existing plant,\n- Consume the same or greener feedstock, and\n- Follow operational procedures that are materially aligned with those of the existing plant.\n\nThis confirmation should be signed off by the borrower’s senior management.\n\n# Scenario 3\n\nAsset acquisition – The borrower is raising money to acquire an asset\n\nA borrower is seeking financing to acquire an existing cement manufacturing plant and retrofit the plant to meet the TSC. The borrower may not be able to provide the data required at the point of financing as it may have limited information on the plant at the pre-acquisition stage.\n\n# Scenario 4\n\nForward-looking TSC – The TSC apply to a future date\n\nWhen financing a new Direct Reduced Iron steel plant for transition, the facility must demonstrate that it “has been designed to and is implementing all necessary actions to meet criteria for” the green category by 2030. The facility can be designed to be 100% hydrogen-based by 2030, but currently uses a mix of natural gas and hydrogen.\n\nThe financier should require the borrower to:\n\n- Provide a timeline for the transition of the plant\n- Provide evidence or commitment of transition through a hydrogen supply agreement\n\nIf the borrower’s operational data after 2030 does not meet the green or amber criteria, the financier should request for a transition plan. In the absence of such a plan, the financier should declassify the financing instrument.\n\nFailure to provide evidence of a technical report confirming GHG emissions levels at the review event after the loan is signed should result in a declassifying of the financing as green or transition.\n",

The financier should require the borrower to:\n\n- Provide industry benchmarks or emission factors of biomass power plants as evidence that GHG emissions profiles would be meeting the TSC, or\n- On a best-effort basis, borrowers can establish data sharing agreements with the downstream operator (the power plant) to provide the required data within a certain period.\n\n13\n",

    "text": "\nGuidance for Leveraging the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy in Green and Transition Financing\n\n# 2 Navigating the amber TSC and labelling post sunset\n\nThe amber category under the SAT refers to activities that are either transitioning towards green within a specified period or enabling significant GHG emissions reductions in the short term. To ensure transition thresholds are credible and foster corporate progress towards green activities, the SAT has set:\n\n- (i) Sunset date(s) to ensure transition remains time-bound, and\n- (ii) TSC that are increasingly stringent towards the sunset dates, to ensure progress on a climate-aligned pathway.\n\nThis forward-looking and time-bound nature of the TSC creates challenges for financiers and borrowers, as providing credible evidence for future data points or commitments can be difficult. The section addresses three such scenarios:\n\n1. At the time of financing\n2. Throughout the financing lifetime\n3. Treatment of a qualifying asset/project upon sunset\n\nTo demonstrate that an activity can meet future criteria, financiers may adopt a risk-based approach in assessing borrowers’ plans to meet future thresholds. SSFA recommends that a borrower provide a science-based climate transition plan that has been independently validated, where feasible, with the project financed being part of such transition plans.\n\nForward-looking information should be accompanied by the methodology and assumptions used, and data points should be verifiable.\n\n\n",

    "text": "\n\nGuidance for everaging the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy in reen and Transition Financing\n\nThroughout the financing lifetime, are interim criteria binding? Is there flexibility in meeting the interim criteria? How frequently should progress toward meeting future criteria be tracked? Is there a grace period for non-compliance with the interim criteria?\n\nRecognising that the path to net zero is non-linear, a financier may offer a borrower flexibility in meeting the interim criteria. Such flexibility could come in the form of a reasonable grace period (recommended 12-36 months) for the borrower to demonstrate clear progress toward meeting those criteria.\n\nBorrowers should have time-bound plans and projections for meeting subsequent TSC, and financiers should engage with borrowers annually or when a material event occurs to ensure no material deviations from technical specifications agreed upon at the point of financing.\n\nExisting financing may continue to be classified as transition throughout the instrument’s tenor, till the sunset date, if the above is fulfilled.\n\nPost the sunset date, what happens to the transition classification?\n\nSSFA recommends inserting a clause in relevant documentation stating that the facility is no longer classified as transition after the sunset date. After the sunset date, no new or existing assets can be recognised as transition. Any new financing or refinancing must meet the green criteria.\n\nTable 1: Thresholds for electricity generation activities (in gCO2/kWh)\n\n|                                                       |   | 2023-2030 | 2031-2035 | 2036-2040\\* | 2041-2050\\* |      |      |\n| ----------------------------------------------------- | - | --------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---- | ---- |\n| Green (lifecycle emissions)                           |   |           |           | ≤100        | ≤100        | ≤90  | ≤50  |\n| Amber (direct emissions)                              |   |           |           | ≤220        | ≤150        | N.A. | N.A. |\n| Ineligible activities                                 |   |           |           | >220        | >150        | >90  | >50  |\n|                                                       |   |           |           | Exclusions: |             |      |      |\n| All solid fossil fuels (e.g., coal, petcoke, lignite) |   |           |           |             |             |      |      |\n\n*Thresholds beyond 2035 are indicative but may be subject to change based on new technologies or evolving scientific views.\n\nSource: Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance (SAT): 2023 Edition, December 2023, Table 1, page 31.\n\nAt the time of financing, if financing takes place in 2026, the borrower should be able to demonstrate the asset has met the amber TSC requirement of ≤220gCO2/kWh direct emissions for 2023-2030.

The 2035 timeline to complete retrofitting is not applicable to countries like Singapore which are alternative energy disadvantaged. Singapore recognises the importance for companies to commit to retrofit the CCGT to be 100% hydrogen-ready to meet Singapore’s net-zero commitment. Given the constraints mentioned above, the timeline to retrofit to 100% hydrogen-ready for Singapore CCGTs will be based on EMA’s forward guidance, e.g. through Singapore’s Emission Standards, when EMA requires CCGTs to be retrofitted to 100% hydrogen-ready.\n\n|                                                                                             | 2023-2028 | 2029-2032 | 2033-2035 |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |\n| Amber (measures), representing CCGT technological readiness for hydrogen or its derivatives | 30        | 50        | 100\\*     |\n\nNew plants need to meet the thresholds set out in the amber measures table.

Singapore’s ability to tap on low-carbon hydrogen to decarbonise will depend on the availability and security of low-carbon hydrogen supply chain in the future, given that we are alternative energy disadvantaged and would not have excess renewable energy to produce low-carbon hydrogen domestically. Furthermore, as 100% hydrogen-ready CCGTs (utility scale) are still being developed, it is uncertain whether such CCGTs can also run on natural gas for baseload generation to meet Singapore’s energy demand or as a backup fuel option in case of hydrogen supply disruption. Hence it may not be feasible for companies to deploy 100% hydrogen-ready CCGTs before hydrogen supply is ready in Singapore.\n\n# At the Time of Financing\n\nAny new or existing combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) asset being financed or re-financed before 2029 must demonstrate it can meet the amber measure of “30% readiness for hydrogen or its derivative” to qualify for transition status. An asset can be classified as amber (measures) even if the direct emissions do not meet the amber TSC requirement in the SAT, as the availability and commercial viability of hydrogen or its derivatives is beyond the borrower’s control. However, it is recommended that the financier engage the borrower on its strategy for hydrogen supply chain development and responsible procurement.\n\n# Throughout the Financing Lifetime\n\nIf the tenor of the financing extends beyond 2029, the financier should consider how the borrower will meet “50% readiness for hydrogen or its derivative”.

Grandfathering rules are more applicable to transition instruments based on milestone criteria (e.g., 2025 to 2035 targets). These have a higher likelihood of being amended to reflect best-in-class practices, when compared with green criteria that take a longer-term view of being aligned to a 1.5°C outcome.\n\nThis section is intended to allow industry participants to engage in financing with confidence despite potential future updates to the SAT. For a previously committed5 amount for loans, or previously allocated6 amount for bonds, the financing can remain classified as transition throughout the instrument’s duration.\n\nFor uncommitted or unallocated amounts, the borrower has a 7-year grace period from the publication of the revised criteria for grandfathering. The instruments must align with the revised TSC by the end of the grace period. This period draws reference from other regions and jurisdictions, ensuring consistency and promoting interoperability. For both green and transition financing, the grandfathering period is set at seven years. While the 7-year period for green financing is based on international precedent, applying the same duration to transition financing is due to industry's preference for consistency and ease of administration across both green and transition financing.\n\nWhen a portfolio approach is adopted, the 7-year grace period also applies. The revised criteria must be applied to the assets in the portfolio, and the allocation report indicating this alignment must be published within the grace period.\n\n5 Whereby a financier is obligated to provide funds upon the borrower's request\n\n6 Whereby a financier has dedicated the bond proceeds to a specific purpose\n\n\n",

The plan should demonstrate the entity’s decarbonisation commitments towards a Paris-aligned pathway. Specifically, the SAT mentions entity-level transition plans in the following scenarios:\n\n1. Industry sector: A 1.5°C-aligned transition plan is required for companies in hard-to-abate sectors to qualify for amber (measures).\n2. Sea and coastal water transport: A 1.5°C-aligned transition plan is required for dual-fuel vessels to qualify for amber (measures).\n3. Early coal phase-out: A dual-level transition plan approach is required. A facility-level just transition plan is mandatory at the facility level to mitigate impacts on stakeholders. A separate entity-level Paris-aligned transition plan must demonstrate the borrower’s broader strategy for phasing out coal assets.\n\nA borrower that can produce an entity-level Paris-aligned transition plan outlining its overall commitment to transition and how the financed projects contribute to this plan will satisfy the entity-level transition plan requirement.\n\n\n",

    "text": "\nGuidance for leveraging the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy in Green and Transition Financing\n\n# Questions &#x26; responses\n\nFor borrowers with Paris-aligned transition plans, what should such plans entail and how can financiers validate the credibility of these plans?\n\nNumerous supra-national organisations, industry associations (e.g. ICMA), ratings agencies and financiers have developed frameworks or guidelines to evaluate companies’ transition plans. Approaches vary widely, however, and some guidelines are industry-specific. For example, the transition pathways for aviation and shipping differ markedly from those in real estate or energy.\n\nThis guidance recognises that plans can be customised based on industry best practices, available technologies, regional contexts and the evolving body of literature. This guidance does not aim to set a standard definition for transition plans or prescribe specific transition pathways.\n\nFinanciers are expected to exercise professional judgment when assessing the credibility and adequacy of a transition plan to determine financing eligibility and alignment under the SAT. SSFA recommends several practical approaches for assessing the credibility of transition plans and encourages industry players to consider these in their assessments:\n\n1. SPOs: Independent SPOs from reputable providers can offer a standardised framework for evaluating transition plans or financing frameworks. Several SPO providers have confirmed they will voluntarily align with ICMA’s Guidelines for External Reviews.\n2. Third-party assessments: Credit ratings agencies and data providers (e.g., Bloomberg, Moody's Ratings, MSCI, S&#x26;P Global Ratings and Sustainable Fitch) have developed bespoke transition assessment products that financiers can leverage. Examples can be found here:\n- Bloomberg’s Transition Credibility Assessment\n- Moody’s Net Zero Assessment\n- MSCI’s Implied Temperature Rise\n- Sustainable Fitch’s Transition Assessment\n- S&#x26;P’s Climate Transition Assessment\n3. Financiers’ internal assessments: To supplement their professional judgement, financiers may reference established frameworks such as:\n- ASEAN Transition Finance Guidance\n- ICMA’s Climate Transition Finance Handbook\n- Transition Plan Taskforce Disclosure Framework (now part of the International Sustainability Standards Board)\n- Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI)\n- CDP Climate Transition Plans\n- Climate Bonds Initiative’s Frameworks to Assess Transition\n- Assessing low-Carbon Transition initiative\n\n\n",

Additionally, borrowers should clearly articulate how current financing contributes to achieving their transition targets.\n\nSSFA recommends financiers evaluate the borrower’s operations, focusing on demonstrable commitments and actions that contribute to climate change mitigation. The following are potential criteria for financiers assessing a transition plan:\n\n- Target-setting: Whether borrowers have science-based decarbonisation targets with explicit milestones that include defined objectives for 2030 and 2050, covering all material GHG emissions scopes of the organisation. This could include the establishment of near-term quantitative GHG emissions reduction targets, increasing the use of renewable energy, increasing the adoption of relevant sustainability certifications (e.g., Bonsucro for sugar cane, RSPO for palm oil and RTSR for soy) and the share of capital expenditure directed towards energy efficiency measures.\n- Business transformation plan: Whether borrowers present comprehensive business plans that align with their transitions, detailing achievable milestones and actions across short-, medium- and long-term horizons to meet established decarbonisation targets. A robust plan incorporates an external engagement strategy to address material scope 3 GHG emissions. It also demonstrates that a low-carbon business model is viable, supporting the borrower’s long-term growth and resilience in a low-GHG emissions economy.\n- Investment plans: Whether borrowers present forward-looking investment plans that support the implementation of their climate transition commitments, including clear timelines and specified investment amounts. The financing strategy can cover capital and operating expenditures.\n\nFinanciers must exercise professional judgment when assessing the actions and commitments of companies without a formal transition plan or in the process of developing them, particularly for small and mid-sized borrowers that may be resource-constrained. A balance must be struck between promoting high-integrity transition financing and acknowledging the challenges faced by companies in developing and disclosing comprehensive transition plans, particularly where they may be critical transition enablers within the value chain. Financiers are encouraged to leverage available tools, technologies and external validation where feasible.\n\nFinanciers and borrowers can also consider leveraging the MAS’ Sustainable Bond Grant Scheme and Sustainable Loan Grant Scheme to offset the expenses incurred for external reviews.\n\n7 Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil\n\n8 Roundtable on Responsible Soy\n\n9 https://www.mas.gov.sg/schemes-and-initiatives/sustainable-bond-grant-scheme\n\n10 https://www.mas.gov.sg/schemes-and-initiatives/sustainable-loan-grant-scheme\n\n24\n",

The SAT has defined transition through two approaches: amber activities and amber (measures).\n\n# Questions &#x26; responses\n\nHow are amber and amber (measures) different in practice?\n\nThe SAT lays out amber criteria for activities that are not yet on a 1.5°C pathway but are either moving toward a green transition pathway within a defined period or facilitating significant GHG emissions reductions in the short term with a prescribed sunset date. At the sunset date, the activity must either already be aligned with the 1.5°C pathway or be downgraded to the ineligible activities category.\n\nOn the other hand, amber (measures) apply to specific components, technologies or processes that reduce an activity's scope 1 and/or 2 GHG emissions, encouraging capital investments that help bring the activity closer to the 1.5°C pathway over time.\n\nThe purpose of amber (measures) is to unlock financing for the decarbonisation of long-life activities (i.e., assets and facilities). The amber (measures) criteria are particularly useful when setting clear thresholds is challenging due to limited data, or where recognising progress toward green is more important than the starting point. This approach encourages GHG emissions reduction in hard-to-abate sectors (e.g., water transport, air transport and industrial) by acknowledging individual decarbonisation efforts.\n\n26\n",

The SSFA notes that certain activities, including those in hard-to-abate sectors, require flexibility in deploying new assets under the transition category while working toward long-term decarbonisation goals.\n\n# Questions &#x26; responses\n\nWhich SAT activities allow for new assets under the amber or amber (measures) criteria?\n\nIn the energy sector, the SAT identifies the following new assets eligible under amber (measures) criteria:\n\n- New power plants (e.g., CCGTs or fuel cells) that can allow hydrogen or its derivatives (e.g., ammonia) that meet the CCGT technological readiness thresholds and criteria in Table 2.2\n- New power plants that capture at least 50% of emissions and are designed to meet green activity criteria by 2035 at the latest\n- New transmission and distribution networks that allow ≥50vol% low-carbon gases\n- New storage systems that allow ≥50vol% low-carbon gases\n\nSource: Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance (SAT): 2023 Edition, December 2023, page 31.\n\nIn the transport sector, the SAT identifies the following new assets eligible:\n\n- New dual-fuel vessels that can be switched to renewables, that derive at least 25% of their energy from zero direct tailpipe CO₂\n\n34\n",

The borrower may also provide an estimate based on the operational data of ships with similar design specifications.\n\nAssuming that the newbuild ship will be operational in 2028, a review should be conducted within a predefined period to assess if the operational data obtained meets the relevant TSC. The borrower shall provide actual fuel consumption for the period.\n\nIf the ship’s operational data is found not to have met the green or amber TSC, the financier should declassify the financing instrument as green or transition.\n\n\n",

    "text": "\nGuidance for Leveraging the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy in Green and Transition Financing\n\n# #9 Recognising enabling and value chain activities that support green and transition activities in the SAT\n\nWhile the SAT covers many economic activities that substantially contribute to climate change mitigation and hence can be classified as green or transition, it may not fully capture certain green- or transition-enabling and value chain activities.\n\nYet, these enabling and value chain activities are crucial drivers of low-carbon transition. These activities provide essential products, services and technologies that help other sectors achieve substantial GHG emissions reductions aligned with science-based pathways.\n\nThere has been progress in defining green-enabling activities, notably through ICMA’s Green Enabling Projects Guidance. However, there is no corresponding list for enabling transition activities.\n\nThe SSFA proposes specific financing approaches to enhance capital flow for these enabling activities, which are often provided by small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nTo mitigate green/transition-washing risks, financiers should ensure that the proceeds are exclusively allocated to enabling projects that meet the TSC for green or amber criteria. There must be reasonable assurance that the financed activities are primarily dedicated to green and transition-related business operations.\n\nFor that purpose, SSFA recommends the following:\n\n- Ring-fencing proceeds: Financing should be structured in alignment with the Green Loan Principles or Green Bond Principles, with a clearly defined Use of Proceeds. This includes\n\n\n",

Financiers should also commit to annual transparency regarding the allocation of funds and the potential environmental and social impacts.\n\n- Avoiding barriers to innovation: Financed activities/assets should not impede the development of low-carbon alternatives.\n- Preventing carbon lock-in: Financed activities/assets should not lead to long-term reliance on high-emission technologies or infrastructure.\n- Traceable end-use: The borrower should engage stakeholders (e.g., customers, project owners) and maintain readily available stakeholder-supplied supporting documentation as evidence that the end-use of the product meets green or transition criteria on a best-effort basis. When possible, the borrower should report the share of activities directly supporting green or transition assets, activities, projects and/or products. If there is a lack of data, financiers and borrowers may refer to Section 1 for guidance.\n- Do No Significant Harm (DNSH): Financiers should conduct comprehensive environmental and social due diligence to ensure that the financed projects have undergone a robust assessment of overall ESG management practices. To ensure ease of use of the taxonomy and encourage its adoption, DNSH is currently best practice under the SAT. For the avoidance of doubt, any project or facilities that are powered by captive coal power plants without a credible and time-bound transition plan shall be deemed as ineligible for transition financing.\n\nFor example: A supplier of a water treatment membrane would obtain the projected net average energy consumption from its customer (the owner of the water treatment project) to show that the green threshold of ≤0.5 kWh/m3 of water produced is met. Transition criteria have a sunset date to ensure the transition does not last forever and that the thresholds facilitate movement towards green. Transition-labelled financing for enabling and value chain activities should therefore follow the sunset date of the corresponding activity.\n\n- Clear, quantifiable, and attributable environmental benefits: Enabling and value chain activities may result in indirect environmental impact and outcomes. On a best-effort basis, the borrower should engage stakeholders to understand such environmental impacts and outcomes. If meaningful, these indirect impacts and outcomes should be assessed and reported.\n\nFor example: A supplier of components for EV charging solutions would obtain the annual actual/estimated avoided GHG emissions based on usage/projected statistics, compared against a baseline scenario.\n\nIn addition to the above, the financiers should assess projects against the following considerations to ensure alignment with credible transition financing principles:\n\n15 Kilowatt-hours per cubic meter, a measure of the amount of energy consumed\n\n38\n",

There is clear scientific evidence that climate change poses one of the greatest existential threats to humanity and the planet. It is a problem which demands action now. While climate change is a global threat, Asia, home to majority of the world’s population, is warming faster than the global average according to the World Meteorological Organization.1\n\nSingapore, as an international financial centre, is well-placed to support the sustainable economy agenda and catalyse sustainable and transition financing needs for the region and globally. To advance on the development, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has convened an industry-led initiative called the Green Finance Industry Taskforce (GFIT) to focus on a few key initiatives, including the development of a Taxonomy.\n\nThis is the final version of the first Singapore-Asia Taxonomy (Taxonomy) issued by GFIT2, convened by MAS and with technical support and recommendations from the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI). GFIT comprises of representatives from financial institutions, corporates, non-governmental organisations, and financial industry associations. All relevant Singapore Government agencies, as well as the public via rounds of consultations, have provided input and feedback into the process. GFIT, MAS, CBI, and the agencies have taken a consensus-based approach to develop the Taxonomy. Regular GFIT meetings and communications were held to discuss and review material points about the Taxonomy. In situations where divergence of views were present, GFIT would consider the recommendations from key parties, revise the criteria and the Taxonomy where required with a pragmatic stance, and explain the rationale in the Taxonomy.\n\nThe Taxonomy is designed to promote the development of an environmentally sustainable economy for Singapore and ASEAN through defining science-based and robust technical screening criteria for economic activities and projects that are aligned with Singapore and region’s overall environmental objectives. In line with the vision of Singapore’s 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for carbon emissions, as well as achieving the targets under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the Taxonomy aims to define the green and transition economy and opportunities. In addition, it serves as a practical guidance for market participants such as asset owners, investment managers, financial institutions, as well as issuers, policymakers, regulators, and other stakeholders to identify and allocate capital to green and transition activities and projects.\n\n\n",

In particular, the following could be considered as useful measures of success:\n\nThe criteria have been developed by environmental and industry experts and reference the latest Singaporean, ASEAN, EU and international thinking.

The Taxonomy also allows a better understanding of the environmental risks facing Singaporean companies under a low-carbon transition pathway. Investing in Taxonomy-eligible activities is not mandatory.\n\nThe Taxonomy includes a list of economic activities and projects that are classified as Green (environmentally sustainable), Amber (transition) or Ineligible on the basis of their contribution to at least one of the Taxonomy’s five environmental objectives, whilst at the same time not causing any significant harm to the other four.\n\n# These five main environmental objectives are aligned with the EU Taxonomy, although at present this Taxonomy has only determined economic activities and technical screening criteria for climate change mitigation. The other four environmental objectives will be added in future iterations:\n\n- Climate change mitigation\n- Climate change adaptation\n- Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity\n- Promote resource resilience and circular economy\n- Pollution prevention and control\n\nThe Taxonomy should allow allocators and providers of capital to align their investments in and lending to different companies, assets and strategies with activities that are classified as green (environmentally sustainable), amber (transition) or ineligible within a flexible classification framework. It is not designed to be an exhaustive or mandatory list of activities or projects for investment, nor does it seek to make any judgments or assessments of the benefits or financial performance of any of the activities and their classification.\n\nThe Taxonomy bridges the gap between international goals and financing practices, clearly signalling the types of activities that are consistent with the low-carbon transition, adaptation to climate change and other environmental objectives.\n\nAssessing the success of the Taxonomy:\n\nThere are a number of key stakeholders that need to embrace the Taxonomy in order for it to be considered a success.\n\n1. The extent to which the Taxonomy is compatible / consistent with other taxonomies. Given capital is global, as are capital market participants, it is important that the Taxonomy is compatible / consistent with other taxonomies. This does not mean that it is identical, more that the Taxonomy should make use of a consistent approach and language and be inter-operable with other taxonomies. There should not be elements that are incompatible. Efforts at tracking such developments are being conducted by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance.\n\n2. The extent to which new products are developed that (or existing products are modified to) align with the Taxonomy. Given the Taxonomy sets the foundations for directing capital to activities that are demonstrably ‘green’, one measure of success is the extent to which capital market participants either develop (or modify existing) products to align with or map to the Taxonomy. The number of products that align with or map to the Taxonomy can be easily tracked.\n\n3. The extent to which regulators reference the Taxonomy when approving products or services. Given consumers of products and services have voiced concerns over ‘greenwashing’ of products, the ability of regulators to refer to a universal reference point (i.e. the Taxonomy) in approving a product as green or otherwise would provide comfort to users.\n\n4. The extent to which other frameworks / standards reference the Taxonomy. Linking with the point below on the compatibility / consistency with other taxonomies, if this outcome can be achieved then one measure of success is the extent to which other frameworks / standards (as they relate to ‘green’ bonds etc.) reference the Taxonomy.\n\n5. The extent to which the Taxonomy is embedded within frontline regulatory disclosure requirements. Given this paper identifies a lack of applicable data as a significant hurdle, one measure of success is the way frontline regulators (stock exchanges, for example) embrace the Taxonomy.\n\nSee: https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/climate-change-impacts-increase-asia\n\nGFIT was convened from Nov 2019 to Apr 2023. In its place, a new Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA) will be set up.\n\n\n",

This should include, where possible, information on the “Do No Significant Harm” clause of the Taxonomy.\n\nDisclosure requirements can be easily tracked. Globally, while taxonomies focus on slightly different objectives based on their jurisdictional context, they are broadly consistent with the six environmental objectives in the EU Taxonomy. In the EU Taxonomy and others, environmental objectives are interlinked – i.e. an activity is included in the Taxonomy if it contributes substantially to one of the objectives while not significantly harming any other objectives.\n\nEvery effort should be taken so as to ensure that tools and support are available for all issuers, including and in particular small and mid-sized enterprises. This is an issue which can and should be monitored at regular intervals.\n\nThe extent to which the disclosure requirements present an ‘undue burden’ on corporates cannot be avoided. However, one success of the Taxonomy would be the extent to which this effort represents an undue burden.\n\nAs the ASEAN region undergoes rapid urbanisation and economic development, it is currently expected to depend on fossil fuels at least in the medium term. The region’s rising fossil fuel demand will increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and exacerbate local air pollution. Hence, economic activities that enable the transition from fossil fuels to increase their carbon efficiency and/or to more sustainable energy sources are essential to mitigate climate change.\n\nFor instance, in Singapore, even with the scale up in solar energy solutions, Singapore will still have a heavy reliance on natural gas in the coming decades due to its limited access to other renewable energy sources. Therefore, it is also important to direct financial resources to activities aimed at making natural gas plants more carbon efficient to support the country’s carbon abatement goals.\n\nMitigating climate change requires reducing the release of GHG emissions in the atmosphere, with the key objective of enacting measures to limit the extent of climate change. An activity can be considered to have met this objective if it makes substantial contribution to:\n\n1. Avoid GHG emissions: These are ‘green activities’, which are already having very low or near-zero emissions. More capital is required to increase their development and wider deployment.\n2. Reduce GHG emissions: These are transition activities that are currently high carbon and critical to the functioning of the economy but are in transition to less carbon-intensive business models. This Taxonomy includes transition activities involving fossil fuels, albeit limited to abated natural gas and managed coal phase-out under certain circumstances.\n\nSingapore aims to increase solar energy deployment by five-fold to at least 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030. However, due to limitations such as its small physical size and land scarcity, Singapore faces challenges in relying on renewable sources to generate sufficient baseload electricity. Therefore, mitigation efforts have also focused on transitioning to natural gas, a comparatively less carbon-intensive fuel, as well as enhancing energy efficiency across the key sectors of power generation, industry, transport, buildings, and households.\n\nFor example, Singapore has set the target of reducing peak land transport emissions by 80% by 2050 from the 2016 peak, with vehicle electrification as the main driver.\n\n# Objective 2: Climate Change Adaptation\n\nClimate change adaptation refers to activities that substantially reduce the adverse impact of the current and expected future climate on either (i) other people, nature or assets or (ii) the economic activity itself, in each case without increasing the risk of an adverse impact on other people, nature and assets.\n\n# Environmental Objectives\n\nThe key purpose of developing the Taxonomy for Singapore-based Financial Institutions (FIs) is to encourage the flow of capital to support the low-carbon transition needed to avoid catastrophic climate change. The Taxonomy intends to cover both green and transition activities with the following five environmental objectives:\n\n1. Climate change mitigation\n2. Climate change adaptation\n3. Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity\n4. Promote resource resilience and circular economy\n5. Pollution prevention and control\n\nThe transition to a circular economy; Pollution prevention and control; The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nIt is recognised that there is also considerable discussion around the issue of methane leakage and natural gas, with scientific evidence growing over time. This is an issue that requires consideration and monitoring.\n\nSource: Renewable Energy Outlook for ASEAN by ASEAN Centre for Energy (ACE) and International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)\n\n\n",

At the same time, the sustainable management of ecosystems and efforts to restore biodiversity is critical to climate change mitigation. For example, conserved or restored habitats such as forests and wetlands are natural carbon sinks and have the added benefit of preventing climatic hazards such as rising sea levels, floods and droughts.\n\nAn economic activity can be considered to meet the objective of climate change adaptation by meeting one, or both, of the following principles:\n\n- Principle 1: The economic activity implements measures to increase own resilience. E.g. raising building heights above projected sea level rises, installing more efficient cooling facilities in anticipation of an increase in the number of warmer days.\n- Principle 2: The economic activity enables other economic activities to adapt to climate change. E.g. providers of cooling systems for buildings, sensors for flood monitoring.\n\nAdditionally, the economic activity should not adversely affect adaptation efforts by others, or increase the physical risks posed to others. E.g. water storage solutions should not deprive others in the communities from accessing water during dry weather.\n\nBy the year 2100, it is projected that Singapore could experience an increase in daily mean temperature by 1.4°C to 4.6°C, more frequent and intense heavy rainfall events, and mean sea level rise of up to 1 meter. Singapore has adopted a Resilience Framework that frames its overall approach to climate change adaptation, which involves assessment of risks, formulation of adaptation pathways, prioritisation and implementation of measures. Additionally, under the Resilient Future vision of the Singapore Green Plan, initiatives have been introduced to:\n\n- (i) complete the formulation of coastal protection plans for certain areas by 2030, and\n- (ii) moderate the rise in urban heat.\n\nObjective 3: Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity (not covered in this version)\n\nClimate change and biodiversity are interconnected. Climate change has compounded biodiversity losses globally, with around a million plant and animal species threatened with extinction within decades. The IPCC has warned that failure to limit global warming to 1.5°C will have long-lasting and severe consequences.\n\nExamples of ecosystem-based adaptation activities include:\n\n1. Coastal defense through the maintenance and/or restoration of mangroves and other coastal wetlands against flooding and protection of natural carbon sinks.\n2. Promote protection, restoration and sustainable use of coastal and marine environment, which provide essential ecological, economic and social services in the ASEAN region.\n3. Enhancing sustainable forest management including afforestation, reforestation and maintenance of forest ecosystem health and vitality to increase carbon storage capacity in forest ecosystems.\n4. Establishment of diverse agroforestry systems to cope with increased risk from changed climatic conditions.\n5. Conservation of agrobiodiversity to provide specific gene pools for crop and livestock adaptation to climate change.\n\nAs also highlighted earlier, an explicit goal of the City in Nature vision under the Singapore Green Plan is to implement species recovery plans for 100 species of plants and 60 species of animals, restore 30 hectares of forest, marine, and coastal habitats, and enhance habitats in at least 50% of Singapore’s gardens, parks, and streetscapes.\n\n6Source: The Centre for Climate Research Singapore.\n\n7https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/wwf_climate__nature_and_our_1_5c_future_report.pdf\n\n8https://www.uncclearn.org/wp-content/uploads/library/unep248.pdf\n\n9https://www.nparks.gov.sg/about-us/city-in-nature\n\n\n",

The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that the global investment in nature-based solutions will need to triple in real terms by 2030 and increase four-fold by 2050 if the world is to meet its climate change, biodiversity and land degradation targets as set out in the three Rio Conventions. The 2050 requirement represents cumulative total investment of up to USD 8.1 trillion. On annual terms, this equates to USD 536 billion each year, up from the current USD 133 billion.¹⁰\n\n# Objective 5: Pollution prevention and control\n\n(not covered in this version)\n\nPollution prevention and control involves practices that prevent, reduce and/or eliminate pollution of air, water or land, and in doing so, mitigate risks or harmful effects to the environment, and to human health. This is important as pollution is a key driver of (i) biodiversity loss and (ii) human diseases. Biodiversity loss as explained earlier is expected to exacerbate global warming through the reduction of natural carbon sinks. Climate change and pollution are thus interconnected; for example, preventing air pollution could contribute to climate change mitigation, while reducing emissions could in turn improve air quality. Pollution is also a significant environmental cause of human diseases which we need to seek to ameliorate. According to the WHO, exposure to air pollution is estimated to cause 7 million premature deaths every year.¹²\n\n# Examples of activities that could contribute significantly to resource efficiency and resilience include:\n\n1. Management of wastes from chemicals, plastics, packaging, electronics, textiles, construction materials, food as well as from oil &#x26; gas mining.\n2. Promote water pollution control measures and cross-border cooperation prioritising water-related development activities.\n3. Eco-friendly consumer packaging.\n4. Sustainable food and agriculture technologies to increase shelf life, reduce wastage from farm to table.\n\n# Guiding principles for the development of the Taxonomy\n\nThe aim of a taxonomy is to provide a common framework for the classification of economic activities to enable stakeholders in gathering information related to green financing, funding, and investment, as well as gain an understanding of risk management and promote investments that meet robust sustainability goals. A taxonomy should allow stakeholders to determine which financial products and services can be classified as green, or environmentally sustainable, over the long term. Furthermore, it should enable transparent and consistent disclosures by corporates of their own economic activities and environmental profile, which then permits transparent and\n\n\n",

Introduction\n\nconsistent classifications and disclosures for Singapore-focused there are similarities, especially with respect to climate change mitigation by operating at near zero emissions, or are on a 1.5°C-aligned pathway.\n\nassociated equity and debt investment, financing, and financial products. In doing so, a Taxonomy would enable growth in sustainable products and services by removing ambiguity and uncertainty around classifications and labels, which in turn may stimulate demand for further environmentally sustainable financing and investment. A taxonomy would also facilitate reporting and classification of portfolios by Financial Institutions, which in turn may further stimulate demand for financial products and services.\n\nOn top of this, a taxonomy could also help Financial Institutions engage with issuers through a common language; the Taxonomy would allow Financial Institutions and issuers to discuss with reference to a benchmark classification system, based in and informed by science, the contribution of their activities to sustainable development.\n\nFinally, a taxonomy could be helpful for macro-prudential regulators that wish to understand potential risks to financial stability that stem from “unsustainable” activities.\n\n# 2. Science-based\n\nThe overall objective of the Taxonomy is to help identify investment consistent with achieving the necessary yet ambitious climate actions. The Taxonomy aims to draw a direct bridge between climate science and usable guidance for the financial sector. The criteria for the Taxonomy are hence based on science as far as possible, and on solid data, with references to data sources provided. In specific cases where a reference to scientific data cannot be provided, this is clearly signaled.\n\nThe technical screening tables indicate which sources have been used as the basis for the science which include the EU Taxonomy, Science-based Targets Initiative, Transition Pathway Initiative, Climate Bonds Initiative as well as academic sources. The selection of science basis was based on what was readily available and usable in the context. As a priority, EU Taxonomy was considered as the first priority. Other sources were chosen in discussion with GFIT, relevant agencies within Singapore and based on available and usable data.\n\n# 3. Economic activity structure\n\nTo identify the economic activities to be covered by this Taxonomy, GFIT defined activities on the basis of ISIC codes (level 3 for activity) given the wide coverage and usage of ISIC. Moreover, this would enable interoperability with other taxonomies such as the Common Ground Taxonomy developed by the International Platform for Sustainable Finance which similarly uses ISIC codes. For this version of the Taxonomy which proposes activity-level criteria and thresholds for three of the eight focus sectors (energy, transport, and buildings), GFIT decided to use a selection of ISIC codes within each of these three sectors. This selection was based on the importance to the Singapore and regional economy, the impact of each activity on GHG emissions (and emission reduction) as well as the ASEAN Taxonomy activity selection (which was also based on similar selection criteria pertaining to the region).\n\n# 3.1 Green activities\n\nThe principle for building the traffic light system is to consider the science-based 1.5°C pathway and the EU Taxonomy criteria for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation as a first option for “green” criteria. In certain cases, the metric and thresholds have then been adapted to reflect Singapore and regional specific circumstances.\n\n# 3.2 Amber activities\n\nThe Amber category in the Taxonomy includes activities that are not presently on 1.5°C pathway, but are either:\n\n- Moving towards alignment with the Paris Agreement\n\n# 3.3 Ineligible\n\nPerformance or activity incompatible with 1.5°C or not possible to assess.\n\n| Emissions              | Amber transition                                           | Green transition     |\n| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |\n| Globally interoperable | Aligned with the Paris Agreement pathway but not near zero | Near Zero activities |\n\nFigure 1: Net-zero pathway for Green, Amber, Ineligible\n\n\n",

    "text": "\nSINGAPORE - ASIA TAXONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE FINANCE | 2023\n\n# Moving towards a Green transition pathway\n\nFor some activities, there are no Amber criteria. This means that the technological options to operate in line with a 1ᵒC pathway are sufficiently developed. Hence, the activity can reasonably meet criteria and thresholds to be considered green in line with the Taxonomy.\n\nThe amber category is, unless otherwise stated, relevant only for transitioning of existing infrastructure and activities and it does not apply to new projects. This is in recognition of the fact that the amber category is, by definition, not aligned with a 1.5°C trajectory and building of new activities with long lifespans beyond the sunset dates, would lock in assets longer into the future, resulting in stranded assets.\n\n# Amber (measures)\n\nIn some sectors of the Taxonomy, Amber (measures) have been proposed to provide additional options for users.\n\nAt the date of publication of this Taxonomy, there was no detail available as to how the Taxonomy would be applied and used. This means that it may be used for classifying CapEx or assets investments through, for example, debt instruments such as green bonds/loans (e.g. China Taxonomy) or disclosure of green revenues (e.g. EU Taxonomy) or both.\n\nGiven this uncertainty as well as the fact that the amber category provides an additional layer of complexity and flexibility to the Taxonomy, amber measures are specified separately to amber activities to provide options at a point in time that are greening the activity even though it may not meet the criteria.\n\n# Transition Requirements\n\nA transition cannot last indefinitely – at some point in time, the amber activity should be following a 1.5°C pathway to net zero otherwise there is no real impact. Transition requires change over time and therefore to demonstrate the transition, there is a need to show how change is happening over time but this is difficult to capture in a binary taxonomy threshold that are static at a point in time.\n\nTo address both issues, Amber criteria have a defined sunset date. At the sunset date, there is no longer an amber category and either the activity is aligned with the 1.5°C pathway (Green category) or it is downgraded to “Ineligible activities” category. As above, this does not mean that the activity has to be zero emissions by the sunset date but rather aligned with the 1.5°C pathway. The intention is that this ensures that transition is not forever and it facilitates change over time by ensuring taxonomy users move towards aligning with Green criteria or risk being ineligible.\n\n# Ineligible Activities\n\nIneligible activities under the Taxonomy may not always indicate significant harm. The Ineligible activities category concerns activities that are not currently eligible under the Taxonomy. The intention of this Taxonomy and the technical work was not to produce a definitive guide to what significant harm (to climate mitigation) or directly unsustainable activities mean across sectors.\n\nThis classification therefore indicates performance thresholds for activities that are not eligible for financing in this Taxonomy. In some cases, this can be implied as harmful and in others, it is less clear. The result remains the same (ineligible) but the perception is different.\n\n# Figure 2: Illustrative 2050 pathways aligned with a range of temperatures\n\n| Time                                                                                           | 2050 |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| Transition pathways that are aligned with a net-zero 2050 end point that are aligned with 4ᵒC. |      |\n\nAnother addition that was made which is different to other taxonomies is to introduce amber measures – these help to demonstrate change over time and are discussed in more detail below.\n\n14New activities are defined as activities that have reached financial investment decision (i.e., date by which investor commitments to invest in activities must be finalised) before 31 Dec 2023. Retrofits to existing infrastructure are not considered new activities but can instead follow criteria for existing activities.\n\n\n",

However, for activities that are very hard to abate, a longer period was given. These activities are not assessed against the traffic light system at this point in time and are not in scope (i.e., they are neither Green, Amber, nor Ineligible).\n\nGFIT does not anticipate that these sunset dates will be altered unless there is a strong case to do so e.g. they are not aligned with up-to-date transition trends in various industries.\n\n- mandatory/voluntary nature of the Taxonomy\n- use of Taxonomy in disclosure guidance/regulation\n- use of Taxonomy in debt financing such as Green bond/loan\n- expectations on frequency of reporting and compliance\n\nWhere possible, thresholds and criteria have been provided for future time periods to provide visibility over how thresholds will change over time following a science-based pathway to net zero. Inclusion of pathways offers the investors and industry planning advantage and greater predictability of potential future conditions, a quality sought from taxonomies that in most cases focused on providing thresholds only for a given point in time.\n\n# Do No Significant Harm\n\nThis final version of the first Singapore-Asia taxonomy is issued by the Green Finance Industry Taskforce (GFIT), convened by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, with technical support and recommendations from the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI). GFIT comprises of representatives from financial institutions, corporates, non-governmental organisations, and financial industry associations. All relevant rounds of consultations have also provided input and feedback into the process.\n\nGFIT notes that these pathways are indicative and may be subject to revisions based on scientific evidence, new available technologies etc. GFIT notes that particularly for criteria far into the future (beyond 2035), there is some uncertainty as to which technologies will be available and the extent to which they are low-carbon. These thresholds should be seen as indicative and may be revised in future iterations.\n\n# Application of the Taxonomy\n\nThe application of the Taxonomy to financial markets, debt instruments such as Green bond/loan, corporate disclosure regulations as well as its voluntary or mandatory status have not yet been decided or put forward for public consultation and are, therefore, at this stage beyond the scope of the Taxonomy.\n\n# Sunset dates\n\nThe Amber criteria have a sunset date to ensure that transition does not last forever and that the thresholds facilitate movement towards green.\n\n| Ineligible                                                 | sunset date          |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |\n| Emissions                                                  | Amber transition     |\n| Moving towards alignment with the Paris Agreement          | Green transition     |\n| Aligned with the Paris Agreement pathway but not near zero | Near Zero activities |\n\nFigure 3: Graphical illustration of sunset date for Amber thresholds\n\nGFIT was convened from Nov 2019 to Apr 2023.

Further, the low-carbon alternatives are both economically and technologically viable in most jurisdictions, meaning that the decarbonisation of electricity generation will be required to be quicker than hard-to-abate sectors where the low-carbon pathways are less clear.\n\nThe Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) pathway for electricity generation shows a 1.5ᵒC pathway decarbonising by 2040.\n\n# Singapore\n\nSingapore has committed to meet a net zero target by 2050 and has enhanced its NDC to reduce emissions to around 60MtCO2e in 2030 after peaking emissions earlier. Power generation accounts for ~40% of Singapore’s total carbon emissions today¹⁷ and decarbonisation of the sector is critical to meet climate pledges.\n\nThe big challenge that Singapore faces in electricity generation is its geography. As a small and highly urbanised city-state with low wind speeds and relatively flat land, the ability to access renewable or alternative clean energy at scale is limited.\n\nTo decarbonise electricity generation, Singapore will continue to enhance the efficiency and reliability of electricity generation from natural gas, while developing and ramping up supply of alternative low-carbon energy sources including¹⁸:\n\n- (i) Solar deployment\n- (ii) Regional power grids to bring in low-carbon electricity by 2035, and\n- (iii) Low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen, geothermal and other technologies such as carbon capture and storage.\n\nSingapore is taking steps to maximise the available spaces for solar deployment, by tapping on locations such as rooftops, buildings, reservoirs, offshore sea space/islets etc. However, based on a study by the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore, Singapore only has a solar potential of approximately 8GWp¹⁹ technical potential. Singapore aims to achieve the solar target of at least 2GWp by 2030 (which will constitute around 3% of the country’s total protected electricity demand in 2030). To complement solar deployment efforts, Singapore has also announced\n\n16 Transition Pathway Initiative\n\n17 Energy Market Authority\n\n19 Based on the updated “Solar PV Roadmap for Singapore” by Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore\n\n",

Hydrogen is an indirect GHG and while there is not yet scientific consensus on its global warming potential, leakages are likely to be problematic and will need to be monitored and mitigated. There is limited data and research on this at this point in time, but this will need to be reviewed and further criteria added as it becomes available.\n\n# TSC overview and methodology\n\nThis section provides an overview of the criteria and the methodology undertaken to develop them for the sector as a whole. Detailed activity-specific criteria are at the end of the chapter.\n\nExisting infrastructure may be retrofitted in line with the Amber measures criteria defined below to qualify for transition finance. These are designed to facilitate reductions in emissions using 2 levers that, at the time of writing, understood to be feasible for the Singapore context:\n\n- Blending of low-carbon gas e.g. hydrogen (as per above)\n- Carbon capture and storage\n\nBoth of these levers are technologically feasible but face some hurdles to reach scale and viability. Following 2030, the assumption is that these key technologies are available and have been implemented.\n\nThe GFIT notes that this approach is not universally recommended in most jurisdictions where fossil fuel electricity generation will need to be phased out entirely to meet climate targets.\n\nFor new projects, this means that the green threshold is at 100gCO2e/kWh to bring the grid average down rapidly. This threshold drops to 50gCO2e/kWh to 2050. This figure is indicative at this point and will likely revise to 0g but is maintained at 50g based on current average emissions associated with renewable energy.\n\n# Choice of metrics\n\nTo be consistent with other global taxonomies including the EU Taxonomy, the primary metric for measuring emissions for electricity generation is gCO₂e/kWh. The Green thresholds are based on lifecycle assessment (LCA) in line with EU Taxonomy.\n\nUltimately, lifecycle emissions are essential to account for GHG emissions throughout the value chain of electricity production processes (e.g., electricity generation from natural gas can have significantly large emissions due to methane leakage during extraction, transportation, and distribution in addition to combustion).\n\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) data on the following page shows the huge range of emissions.\n\n\n",

applicable\n\nAmber measures Meet one of the following criteria:\n\n- Retrofit of existing power plants to allow hydrogen or its derivatives (e.g. ammonia) that meet the CCGT technological readiness thresholds and criteria in Table 2.2, or\n- New power plants (e.g. CCGTs or fuel cells) that can allow hydrogen or its derivatives (e.g. ammonia) that meet the CCGT technological readiness thresholds and criteria in Table 2.2, or\n- Retrofit of existing plants with CCS that is designed at the outset to allow the facility to meet the green criteria by 2035 at the latest, or\n- New power plants that capture at least 50% of emissions and are designed to meet green activity criteria by a 2035 at the latest, or\n- Retrofit of existing transmission and distribution networks that allow ≥50vol% low-carbon gases, or\n- New transmission and distribution networks that allow ≥50vol% low-carbon gases, or\n- Retrofit of existing storage systems that allow ≥50vol% low-carbon gases, or\n- New storage systems that allow ≥50vol% low-carbon gases; or\n- Other investments directly supporting or facilitating hydrogen uptake in the plant are eligible if the measures result in the new plant to allow ≥50vol% hydrogen or its derivatives, (e.g. purchase, operation, and maintenance measures).\n\nAnd, all measures must meet the following criteria:\n\n- The power cannot be generated from renewable energy sources, based on a comparative assessment with the most cost-effective and technically feasible renewable alternative for the same capacity identified; the result of this comparative assessment is published and is subject to a stakeholder consultation.\n\nAmber measures can be new and qualifying measures do not need to meet the amber activity thresholds in Table 1.\n\nUpper thresholds should be used to ensure that fugitive emissions are not high enough to mean that there is no climate value to the importation of electricity as a decarbonisation lever.\n\n*Criteria have an initial sunset date of 2035 after which point they will not be applicable. The criteria and sunset dates are not fixed and will be reviewed and possibly revised periodically based on emerging science and technology.\n\nNote: Renewable and low-carbon gases include non-fossil gaseous fuels, such as biomethane and biogas, as well as hydrogen and its derivatives.\n\n\n",

Singapore’s ability to tap on low-carbon hydrogen to decarbonise will depend on the availability and security of low-carbon hydrogen supply chain in the future given that we are alternative energy disadvantaged and would not have excess renewable energy to produce low-carbon hydrogen domestically. Furthermore, as 100% hydrogen-ready CCGTs (utility scale) are still being developed and it is uncertain whether such CCGTs can also run on natural gas for baseload generation to meet Singapore’s energy demand before hydrogen supply is available and as a backup fuel option in case of hydrogen supply disruption. Hence it may not be feasible for companies to deploy 100% hydrogen-ready CCGTs before hydrogen supply is ready in Singapore. |           |           |           |                                                               |\n|                                                              | For 2033-2035, the deployment of new 50-100% hydrogen-ready CCGT would be provided as a forward guidance by EMA, based on when we expect utility-scale units to be available with acceptable reliability, efficiency, and baseload compatibility with natural gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |           |           |           |                                                               |\n|                                                              | For CCGTs that had secured financing before the thresholds were ratcheted up in 2029 and 2033, the plants will have to demonstrate that they have an entity level target to retrofit and be 100% ready no later by 2035 if not earlier. The 2035 timeline to complete retrofitting is not applicable to countries like Singapore which are alternative energy disadvantaged. Singapore recognises the importance for companies to commit to retrofit the CCGT to be 100% hydrogen-ready to meet Singapore’s net-zero commitment. Given the constraints mentioned above, the timeline to retrofit to 100% hydrogen-ready for Singapore CCGTs will be based on EMA’s forward guidance, e.g. through Singapore’s Emission Standards, when EMA requires CCGTs to be retrofitted to 100% hydrogen-ready with baseload compatibility with natural gas.                                                                                            |           |           |           |                                                               |\n\n# 1.3.

determining the thresholds for conversion and transport of hydrogen carriers become available and introduced in the taxonomy.

The reconversion process could be avoided by directly using the renewable energy produced. In Singapore, however, this is permitted due to the following conditions: i) On-site renewable energy production capacity is not sufficient to meet the demand, ii) There is no sufficient availability of renewable energy for purchase to meet the demand.\n\n25Further guidance on comparative assessments will follow.\n\n\n",

Hence, selected activities within the transport sector do not have an Amber category, especially activities for which zero-emission alternatives exist. Thus, the Amber category is only available for heavy-duty vehicles, sea and coastal water transport, land water transport, and air transport.\n\nThe process of designing technical screening criteria also considered the key transport-related initiatives and targets announced by the Singapore Government, in support of its enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution, Long Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy, and the Singapore Green Plan26.\n\nFor shipping technical screening criteria for green category have been put forward based on Climate Bonds Initiative Criteria developed for the sector. The metrics used by CBI include Energy Efficiency Operational Index and The Annual Efficiency Ratio as defined by IMO. For Amber we refer to the emission reduction ambition levels devised by IMO. While it is not significant for Singapore itself, inland water transport has been included, given the objective of the Taxonomy to cater to the needs of the international financial institutions operating in Singapore.\n\nOnly existing projects are eligible in the Amber categories. The exception is for new projects in sea and coastal, and inland water transport Amber (measures) that have to demonstrate their ability to retrofitted to be Green-eligible before the sunset date, or can be switched to renewables – for e.g., dual-fuel vessels that can switch to renewables. New projects under Air Transport, Amber (measures) such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel are also allowed.\n\nSunset date at 2030 applies for amber category for sea and coastal transport for activities aligned with IMO pathways. Amber criteria for inland water transport will have to be revised, for the taxonomy to offer guidance on thresholds beyond 2025. Amber criteria for heavy-duty vehicles will have to be revised by 2030 the latest. Similarly, the sunset date stated under amber measures for air transport applies only to the stated criteria for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and not SAF as a measure. Appropriate thresholds for SAF will be considered in subsequent editions to reflect latest developments, recognizing that SAF is a key decarbonisation lever for the international aviation sector that will feature till 2050 and beyond and ICAO is still in the midst of developing an overall decarbonisation pathway for international aviation.\n\n26 https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/files/resources/cos-sgp-factsheet.pdf\n\n27 https://www.climatebonds.net/standard/shipping\n\n\n",

It can either be calculated from fuel consumption measurements and information on cargo carried and distance travelled or estimated using satellite tracking data and fleet technical specifications. EEOI therefore accounts for the real operating conditions of the vessel and their impact on fuel consumption (e.g., speed, weather, draught).\n\n30 Possible measures include but are not limited to those captured in Appendix M4 of the ICAO’s Report on the Feasibility of a Long-term Aspirational Goal. If the vessel operates 100% of the time on voyages that include the EU, then it must report using EEOI. Vessels which are not operating 100% of the time on voyages that include the EU can opt to report EEOI but are required to verify this data independently.\n\n33 The Annual Efficiency Ratio (AER) measures carbon emissions associated with transport work, but it uses a ship’s size (deadweight) as a proxy for cargo carried and assumes that the ship is fully loaded on all journeys.\n\n\n",

Metrics for measuring buildings vary around the world and a key challenge for setting buildings criteria and thresholds in taxonomies is to maintain a balance between usability and interoperability. While this is a challenge throughout the Taxonomy, in the buildings sector it is particularly acute given that most regions or countries already have a local buildings code or standard that is already being used locally (although to different degrees around the world). To maintain usability, local standards need to be used to whatever extent possible while also recognising that some of them may be insufficient on their own.\n\nComparing buildings standards, codes and labels around the world is a huge challenge, not least because buildings labels are scoring methodologies which measure a range of different metrics. Some of these metrics are climate related (energy efficiency, emissions etc) while others are not directly (water consumption, recycling infrastructure etc.). As a result, a building with a high score may receive this for largely non-energy related reasons which would not be aligned with the objective (climate mitigation) in this Taxonomy.\n\n# TSC overview and methodology\n\nIn the EU, the main metric is Primary Energy Demand (PED). The Taxonomy aims to set defined emissions intensity thresholds in line with Singapore’s transition pathway. Singapore’s Green Mark Certification is used in this Taxonomy as a key starting point; it is a rigorous and ambitious green building rating system to evaluate a building's environmental impact and performance with climate mitigation credentials that are broadly aligned with EU approach. It is seen as a highly ambitious scheme internationally and intends to align with the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG13 on climate action. It is also used as a benchmark for existing requirements and/or schemes; for example, it being used by GreenGov.SG for all new public sector buildings and existing public sector buildings under retrofit as a key enabler for the public sector to meet government sustainability targets.\n\n| Category   | Main Technical screening criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Additional metrics    |\n| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |\n| Green      | • Prevailing Green Mark certification38 (all levels) • Buildings meeting CBI certification • Other eligible international certification: Edge, NABERS, Australian Green Star – see Table 4 and Table 5                                                          |                       |\n| Amber      | • No Amber category for new buildings • For renovation, 30% reduction in emissions or energy consumption (based on energy usage, Primary Energy Demand or GHG emissions) up to 2030 (sunset date) based on Singapore’s required emissions intensity transition. | • Sunset date of 2030 |\n| Ineligible | • Buildings dedicated to fossil fuel use (consistent with treatment of fossil fuels in energy; however, this would not apply to indirect activities e.g., a green building will be eligible even if rented by a fossil company).                                |                       |\n\n38The most updated version of Green Mark as of this current Taxonomy iteration is Green Mark 2021.\n\nI T C R T C / E T T E E R\n",

Once indirect emissions from energy use are considered that share increases to 34%. Over the last decade emissions from the industry (and transport) sector increased most rapidly.\n\nImportantly, industry faces a dual challenge – on one hand, reducing its own emissions and on the other hand manufacturing the technological solutions that will play an enabling role in the emissions reduction in other areas of whole economy. Thus, it is necessary to steer financial flows both43:\n\n- to the activities that have the highest share in the GHG emissions, (referred to as hard-to-abate activities)\n- - e.g. manufacturing of iron and steel, of basic chemicals, cement, aluminium and hydrogen44\n\nto the activities that have the highest share in the GHG emissions, (referred to as hard-to-abate activities)\n\nThe IPCC AR6 report highlights that the enormous challenge in achieving a net-zero objective in the coming decade. However, decarbonisation is not impossible, owing to ongoing technological developments, and broad adoption of mitigation, adaptation, and resilience measures across value chains.\n\nThe primary levers for decarbonisation include, among others:\n\n- Electrification,\n- Non-fossil-based inputs,\n- Use of various low-carbon fuels (e.g. hydrogen) for heat applications,\n\nTechnical screening criteria – emission thresholds for sectors that are characterised by high GHG emissions (basic chemicals, steel, cement, hydrogen, aluminium) as have been developed based on the 1.5°C science-based decarbonisation pathways – an approach adapted from Climate Bonds Initiative’s criteria.\n\nGiven the broad scope covered by the manufacturing sectors please refer to detailed sectoral criteria, given that there might be some deviations from the outlined approach and methodology.\n\n42 IPCC AR6 Report\n\n43 While manufacture of biofuels has also been identified as a key area for green growth, it is not scoped in this current Taxonomy due to a lack of credible references. Instead, it'll be included in future Taxonomy.\n\n44 While manufacture of biofuels has also been identified as a key area for green growth, it is not scoped in this current Taxonomy due to a lack of credible references. Instead, it’ll be included in future Taxonomy iterations when there is clearer global guidance.\n\n45 Given the broad scope covered by the manufacturing sectors please refer to detailed sectoral criteria, given that there might be some deviations from the outlined approach and methodology.\n\n\n",

As far as possible, the thresholds have been projected into the future so that the user can see how the thresholds will change over time as they ratchet down towards 2050 (see Figure 7). This is an extension of the EU approach where the EU criteria are put forward for the current period with the understanding that these will be revised downwards every 5 years (to be confirmed). The approach is intended to provide greater certainty for users to see how activities need to decarbonise to remain green although it is noted that thresholds, particularly those further in the future, are based on today’s understanding of the future and what is possible, what may change as new technologies become available etc.\n\nWherever possible, science-based transition pathways have been adopted from other initiatives, which approach pathway development process with a high degree of scrutiny from academia and industry experts such as these developed by the IEA or the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi).\n\n# Basic information about decarbonisation pathways used is provided in the table below – more details can be found in J.\n\n| Basic chemicals | Teske et al. (2022); ICF and Fraunhofer ISI study for the EC (2021) |\n| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Cement          | Science-Based Targets Initiative                                    |\n| Iron and Steel  | IEA Net-Zero Emissions (IEA NZE)                                    |\n| Hydrogen        | MIT Energy Initiative’s SESAME platform                             |\n| Aluminum        | International Aluminum Institute based on IEA                       |\n\nPlease refer to Table 19 in Appendix J for details.\n\n# Approach to setting TSC for high emitting sectors\n\nGiven the scale of the challenge associated with the decarbonisation of the selected industry sectors and lack of technologically and economically feasible low-carbon alternatives, these sectors have been defined as inherently “in transition”. Enabling sectors are those focused on manufacturing of net-zero aligned products and technologies. These sectors have TSC that are more qualitative and less dynamic – not associated directly with decarbonisation pathway, often introducing the links to criteria established for the associated economic activities. The Green thresholds adopted for these activities have been, in most cases, are from the EU Taxonomy.\n\nThis means that while in other sectors, it makes sense to create a line between ineligible and Amber performance, for most industry sectors, this line is problematic for a few reasons:\n\n1. The data is not available to create a line with any credibility or science basis meaning that the line between ineligible and Amber would be arbitrary;\n2. For many activities, performance at the activity level (or, in the case of industry, a plant or facility) will vary significantly but the aim is for all facilities to move to a Green transition pathway within a time period. The starting point is therefore not important compared to the movement towards green over time.\n\n# Figure 9: Theory of change behind measures-based approach\n\nThis means that while in other sectors, it makes sense to create a line between ineligible and Amber performance, for most industry sectors, this line is problematic for a few reasons:\n\n# Companies decarbonise by...\n\n...decarbonising their activities which can be decarbonised by...\n\n# ...implementing individual measures\n\n\n",

    "text": "\nSINGAPORE - ASIA TAXONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE FINANCE | 2023\n\nImpact on usability of measures-based approach – promoting planning focused on alignment of the activity with the decarbonisation pathway, for the measures-based approach, the requirement of the 1.5°C-aligned transition plan has been introduced. We recommend for the transition plans to be prepared in line with Transition Finance Principles outlined by the IPSF. While today the requirement is for the entities to develop 1.5°C-aligned transition plan, likely, with future revisions of the Taxonomy, further provisions regarding the contents and level of ambition might be introduced.\n\nThe Amber category that applies to investment measures cannot, however, be used to assess revenues. It can only be used for the purpose of defining the alignment of CapEx. Such an approach has a major upside in that by acknowledging individual decarbonisation efforts rather than solely end-effects, it could help fast-track emissions reduction from hard-to-abate sectors. To further leverage that effect, TSC require that measures are implemented by 2035, limiting the timeframe for enabling meaningful, but nevertheless insufficient, from the net-zero perspective, improvements. This short-term period aims to offer an opportunity to reward positive climate impacts, while low and zero-emission technologies remain under-developed and expensive.\n\n# Figure 10: Measures-based approach for Amber category for selected sectors\n\n# Table 9 Usability implications of measures-based approach to Amber category\n\n| Criteria for Amber (measures)                                   |                         | Criteria for Amber        | Criteria for Green |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |\n| Specific measures                                               | Taxonomy end-use: CapEx | Taxonomy end-use: Revenue | Green criteria     |\n| Activities                                                      | Green                   | Amber (measures)          | Ineligible         |\n| Manufacture of basic chemicals                                  | X                       | X                         | X                  |\n| Manufacture of cement                                           | X                       | X                         | X                  |\n| Manufacture of aluminum                                         | X                       |                           | X                  |\n| Manufacture of hydrogen                                         | X                       | X                         | X                  |\n| Manufacture of plastics in primary form                         | X                       |                           | X                  |\n| Manufacture of batteries                                        | X                       |                           | X                  |\n| Manufacture of renewable energy technologies                    | X                       |                           | X                  |\n| Manufacture of equipment for the production and use of hydrogen | X                       |                           | X                  |\n| Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transport            | X                       |                           | X                  |\n| Manufacture of energy efficiency equipment for buildings        | X                       |                           | X                  |\n| Manufacture of other low-carbon technologies                    | X                       |                           | X                  |\n\nIn most cases, there is no Amber category but new activities, and thus manufacturing of associated new products and technologies, have to meet thresholds set for Green category. Activities that do not meet Green TSC are classified as Ineligible activities.\n\nInteroperability with Climate Bonds Initiative and EU Taxonomies – rationale for selection of pathways designed by Climate Bonds Initiative. Additionally, CBI criteria offer increased stringency due to the presence of cross-cutting requirements focused on e.g. feedstock or energy-used.\n\nThe Taxonomy proposes different criteria for CapEx (Amber measures) and for revenue (Amber activities). These are potentially eligible for Amber category within sustainable finance (noting that some international investors may choose not to invest in Amber) for a labelled bond. However, revenues generated from the activity will not be eligible as Amber activities under any disclosure guidelines/requirements until they meet the Amber thresholds.\n\nHowever, to increase interoperability between taxonomies, EU thresholds have been used as a starting point for ratcheting ambition up to net zero. Such approach encourages also pro-active uptake of global decarbonisation pathways (e.g. IEA’s) by CBI criteria helps to ensure their universal application and thorough engagement of technical and industry experts in the criteria development process enhances their usability by stakeholders.\n\n46https://finance.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-11/221109-international-platform-sustainable-report-transition-finance_en.pdf\n<page_footer>47While the requirement for the entity to have a 1.5°C-aligned transition plan has been introduced just for the investments in measures that are classified as Amber transition plans are regarded as best practice and development of the 1.5°C, science-based transition plan is encouraged for all entities.</page_footer>\n",

Manufacture of basic iron and steel\n\nContext and methodology notes\n\nMost new steel plants built today will still be online in 2050. There are already low-carbon steel production technologies available, and it is expected that more will become commercially ready before and beyond 2030.\n\nSince steel production facilities can operate for many years, new facilities should already be built with CO2 emissions mitigation technologies in place or avoiding CO2 generation entirely by limiting the use of fossil fuels. The technical challenges are such that this is very important at the design stage – if a plant is not designed to have, for example, CCS implemented, it is very difficult to retrofit later.\n\nTo acknowledge and promote the decarbonisation efforts, (new and existing) facilities that do not meet criteria designed for Green category at the outset but have been designed to and envisage full alignment over time and by 2030 latest, can be classified as Amber.\n\nAt the same time, current technologies for refurbishment cannot bring long-existing Blast Furnace-Basic Oxygen Furnace (BF-BOF) plants in line with a 1.5°C pathway. These are old technologies and retrofit opportunities are limited. Such plants will need to be phased out in the long term. However, in many cases, short term emissions can be reduced to the levels required in 2030 – these should be maximised. When looking at existing facilities, the criteria below aim to avoid investments that would lock-in heavy emitting technologies, without overlooking those producers that will make credible efforts to reduce their current emissions.\n\nLiterature review shows that around 71% of steel’s global coal-based capacity will require reinvestment by 2030. Steel producers can either invest in ‘relining’ (extension of a life-span of the investment) or switch to alternative technologies. Relining is discouraged within these criteria as it risks locking-in assets that are not compatible with a low-carbon future. Consequently, we have limited the age of eligible blast furnaces.\n\nY R T S U D N I\n",

    "text": "\nForestry\n# Context\n\nThe forestry sector has immense potential to provide environmental services that are extremely important in the fight against climate change. Forestry can also play an important role in the local economy through sustainable and regenerative systems. Forests can not only sequester and mitigate emissions of GHG, but they also play an important role in keeping biodiversity assets intact.\n\nAfforestation, reforestation, and forest management to maximise carbon sequestration are recognised as key strategies for climate change mitigation in line with a 1.5°C pathway through removing CO2 from the atmosphere and slowing global warming. However, the actual mitigation effect of forestry activities is influenced by many factors, such as location, scale and management effectiveness.\n\nClimate change mitigation in the forestry sector is also strongly linked to avoiding deforestation and land-use change. Peat fires are also a major contributor to GHG emissions in Indonesia (40% of the total in 2005 and, in 2015, rivalling daily emissions in the U.S.) and could add an estimated 1 billion tons to the country’s carbon footprint. The total carbon content of forests has been estimated at 861Gt of carbon for 2011, which is more than the amount of carbon in the entire atmosphere. According to the IPCC in its Sixth Assessment Report, reducing and/or preventing deforestation is the mitigation option with the largest and most immediate carbon stock impact in the short term.\n\n# TSC overview and methodology\n\nDue to the diversity embedded in the forestry sector, the approach to identifying green agricultural practices and activities does not consider quantitative metrics and/or criteria. Instead, it classifies activities and sub-activities according to the “traffic light” methodology where green are activities that are encouraged, amber are activities that should either be phased out or changed over time, while the rest are considered ineligible activities. This approach is similar to the one used for the construction of the Colombian Taxonomy.\n\n# Categorisation of activities\n\nFor the forestry sector, it is possible to group activities in three big groups, defined by the objectives and outputs of each operation in the sector. The activities here have been mapped and grouped as follows:\n\n- Sustainable forest management – a system that ensures that forests supply goods and services meet both present-day and future needs and contribute to the sustainable development of communities;\n- Forestry plantation – type of managed forest in which the trees are planted (as opposed to naturally regenerated), of the same age and generally of the same species, and are intended to maximise the production of wood fibre;\n- Conservation, restoration and maintenance – actions needed to protect and assure that environmental services are provided by natural/pristine forests.\n\n# How to use these criteria\n\nThe criteria have been designed to be applicable to granular green activities as well as to the wider level. For example, some of the criteria are suitable for green use of proceeds instruments, such as green bonds, where a bond is raised for a specific project or asset (e.g. nurseries) while others (e.g. the proxy certification standards) are applicable at the forestry project level and could be used as part of corporate disclosure to classify green revenues. Note that for an activity to be effectively considered as green, it should be in line with the relevant related guidelines in one or more of the listed credible certification schemes (e.g. Forest Stewardship Council – FSC and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification – PEFC).\n\n\n",

As a result, any land use with more than the average C stock per hectare of oil palm, i.e., more than 35tC/ha, is considered high carbon stock. Forest classification types can be used as a proxy for the classification. For example, in Indonesia, lands classified as “Mostly young re-growth forest, but with occasional patches of older forest within the stratum,” or above in terms of biomass are considered HCS land.\n\n\n",

CCS includes a range of different process and technology options to capture and store CO2. According to IEA, CCS is an important decarbonisation lever for hard-to-abate sectors and will contribute to achieving global climate goals.\n\nSingapore is studying emerging low-carbon technologies such as Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS). This includes the study “Carbon Capture, Storage, and Utilisation: Decarbonisation Pathways for Singapore’s Energy and Chemicals Sectors”59 which was commissioned by the government and concluded in June 2021. Singapore does not have any known suitable reservoirs for the permanent storage of CO2 in its subsurface, but analysis of the geological storage potential in neighbouring countries indicates an estimated regional storage potential of 84.8 Giga tons60 (Singapore’s annual emissions are approximately 0.5 Gigatons61. Currently, Singapore is targeting at least 2 million tons of carbon capture by 2030 and more than 6 million tons/year by 2050, as it transforms its Jurong Island downstream oil hub into an energy and chemicals park.\n\nAs a relatively mature technology, CCS is gaining traction as a decarbonisation lever in recent decades. However, scientists have exercised caution in promoting the role of CCS across the economy. While it is broadly agreed that CCS will play a role, there remain economic viability constraints, uncertainty around the long term nature of storage and limits to storage reservoirs and capacity (in the short-to medium term).\n\n# Classification of CCS Activities\n\n- Point-source capture of CO2 is the process of capturing CO2 from a large emissions source – e.g. an industrial facility. Most CCS projects utilise point source capture given the higher concentrations of CO2 make the capture process more efficient. Point-source capture is listed here for completeness of the process but it cannot be viewed as a standalone activity because it is never carried out separately from a certain industrial or power generation activity. Its main goal is to decrease the emissions of the activity it is linked to. Point-source capture is not a separate activity in other taxonomies and is mostly mentioned in this Taxonomy as a part of industrial activities criteria.\n- Transportation of captured CO2 can be done by various means, including pipelines, ships, railroad cisterns or trucks.\n- Permanent sequestration of captured CO2 includes injecting of CO2, removed by point- or direct air capture of CO2 within an underground geological formation, whereby the fraction of carbon dioxide stored through mineral carbonation that is retained after 1000 years is virtually certain to be 100%. As a consequence, the need for monitoring the disposal sites will be limited in the case of mineral carbonation (IPCC Special Report).\n- Research, development and innovation for CCS-related technologies. Research activities that are related to CCS are included in the Taxonomy to underline the importance of the development of this field.\n\n59 https://file.go.gov.sg/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage-decarbonisation-pathway-for-singapore-energy-and-chemical-sectors-pdf.pdf\n\n60 Ibid.\n\n61 Gigaton = 1,000,000,000 Tonnes\n\n\n",

Huge quantities of CO2 are currently used each year, mainly in the fertiliser industry and for enhanced oil recovery while new utilisation pathways in the production of CO2-based synthetic fuels, chemicals and building aggregates are gaining momentum. For these reasons, the precautionary principle was applied, and utilisation is not eligible within this Taxonomy. This may well change in the future as clearer guidelines become available.\n\n# Activity technical screening criteria\n\n# 6.1.

Although not usually high-emitting itself (there is almost no Scope 1 emission, only Scope 2 and 3 emission), this sector is important for digital transformation and the improvement of efficiency of activities in emissions-intensive sectors. Today roughly over 2% of all emissions in the world can be attributed to ICT sector, but this figure will grow in the future as demand increases. Even as emissions from the sectors rise, a report by the Global e-Sustainability Initiative estimates that IT solutions can help cut nearly 10 times more CO2 than they emit.\n\nUnder the ISIC code, Section J, ICT includes publishing activities, telecommunications and data processing and hosting activities. Most ICT activities have limited climate impact and they are not generally included in major taxonomies. For the Singapore Taxonomy, the GFIT selected data centres as the most important activities within the ICT sector for emission reductions within the Singapore Taxonomy.\n\n# TSC overview and methodology\n\nSingapore context\n\nSingapore has, in the last decade, become a major hub for data centres within the ASEAN region. In the country itself they account for 7% of total energy requirements. As data centres are intensive users of resources like land, water and energy, the Government informed the industry of a temporary pause in the growth of DCs in 2019 and embarked on a review. The pause was lifted in 2022 with the launch of pilot Data Centre – Call for Application (DC-CFA) exercise that invited innovative proposals from the industry. Together they consume almost 7% of the country's total energy requirements. This number is expected to hit 12% by 2030.\n\nIn simple terms, data centre activities can be divided into two parts: the hardware and software. The hardware component covers construction, as well as storage, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or processing of data through data centres.\n\nThe Government has recently announced that it will award 80MW of new capacity to four data centre operators selected through the pilot DC-CFA exercise, where the selected data center operators proposed sustainability measures such as achieving PUE of 1.3 or lower, as well as a Platinum rating under the Green Mark Scheme for New Data Centres.\n\n65 Global e-Sustainability Initiative &#x26; Accenture Strategy (2015) ICT Solutions for 21st Century Challenges. https://smarter2030.gesi.org/downloads/Full_report.pdf\n\n66 https://news.nus.edu.sg/nus-and-ntu-launch-first-of-its-kind-tropical-data-centre-testbed/\n\n67 https://techwireasia.com/2022/04/singapore-data-centres/\n\n\n",

The GWP of refrigerants applies the same criteria across Green and Amber due to low cost of complying with it and huge negative effect in case if it is relaxed. Concerning the software and solutions, the final decision on the compatibility can be made only after the final choice of “substantial contribution” definition is made. The EU Taxonomy solves this issue by stating that “where an alternative solution/technology is already available on the market, the ICT solution demonstrates substantial lifecycle GHG emission savings compared to the best performing alternative solution/technology. Lifecycle GHG emissions and net emissions are calculated using Recommendation 2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using ETSI ES 203 199, ISO 14067:2018 or ISO 14064-2:2019. Quantified lifecycle GHG emission reductions are verified by an independent third party which transparently assesses how the standard criteria, including those for critical review, have been followed when the value was derived.\n\n# Activity technical screening criteria\n\n# 7.1.

Development of such software is a nascent field. These solutions make lesser impact on Taxonomy’s objectives but is also important. Thus, it is added as Amber criteria-compliant activity without any additional thresholds.\n\n# Energy sourcing\n\nReplacement of fossil fuels generation with renewables generations can help further reduce scope 2 emissions, especially once marginal efficiency gains become more expensive to improve.\n\n# Refrigerant Global warming potential (GWP)\n\nRefrigerants that are used within data centres are liquids or a gas with a very low boiling point. Refrigerants, such as hydrofluorocarbons, and fire suppressants are powerful greenhouse gases with global warming potential (GWP) hundreds to thousands of times more potent per unit than carbon dioxide. Their effect on climate is measured in GWP units where lower GWP refrigerants can.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy provides criteria both for data centres and software, and in overwhelming majority of cases they are compatible with the ones.\n\n692022 Best Practice Guidelines for the EU Code of Conduct on Data Centre Energy Efficiency (2022). Link\n\n70 Link\n\n71 The most updated scheme as of this current Taxonomy iteration is the BCA-IMDA Green Mark for New Data Centres (2019). For the Platinum rating, PUE thresholds are: 1.50 at 25% IT load; 1.45 at 50% IT load; 1.39 at 75% IT load; 1.35 at 100% IT load.\n\n72 In Singapore, under the Environmental Protection and Management Act (EPMA), the GWP of refrigerant used in electrically driven water-cooled chillers with cooling capacity of 1,055kW or more that is used for one or more purposes that include producing chilled water for air-conditioning must not exceed the prescribed GWP limit of 15. This includes water-cooled chillers that produce chilled water for the cooling of data server halls/rooms and office spaces in data centres.\n\n68 Link\n\n\n",

The Code of Practice on Environmental Health (COPEH), provides guidelines to address environmental health concerns in the design of buildings, and stipulates minimum design criteria on refuse and recyclables collection.\n\nIn Singapore, around 6.94MTs of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) was generated in 2021, with an overall recycling rate of 55%. Most of the waste is attributed to non-domestic sources (74%), and around 80% of total MSW is treated by Waste-to-Energy (WtE) plants (NEA, 2022). Currently, there are four WtE plants, a transfer station and one offshore landfill. Given Singapore’s land constraints, there is limited space inland for additional MSW facilities. Nonetheless, Singapore aims to be a zero-waste nation by strengthening its climate, resource and economic resilience and adopt a circular economy approach to sustainable waste and resource management (NEA, 2022).\n\nThe Singapore Taxonomy for the Waste sector is developed for Singapore-based Financial Institutions (FIs) to guide business activities in\n\n| Most      | Prevention |\n| --------- | ---------- |\n| Preferred | Re-use     |\n|           | Recycling  |\n|           | Recovery   |\n| Least     | Disposal   |\n\nFigure 13: Waste Hierarchy\n\n\n",

It includes key activities to ensure better and efficient recycling. WtE has been included considering the local context, however, the thresholds are strict to ensure that only efficient plants are considered. Additionally, direct disposal of waste at WtE plants without pre-sorting or segregating of recyclables is not considered under Green or Amber categories. The sunset date for Amber for activities under the Waste sector will be until 2030 unless stated otherwise. Residual waste refers to non-recyclable fraction of the waste. Segregation refers to separating waste into different fractions such as biowaste, recyclables, etc.\n\n- Collection and transport of non-hazardous waste\n- Biowaste treatment: composting of biowaste\n- Biowaste treatment: anaerobic digestion\n- Waste-to-Energy (WtE)\n- Landfill gas capture and utilisation (not directly applicable to Singapore)\n- Material recovery facilities\n\nThe metrics chosen for activities related to collection and transportation and biological treatment of waste (composting and anaerobic digestion) are qualitative, as the climate mitigation effect is an inherent result of the economic activities. The mitigation of GHG emissions occur by the process of transformation of waste into by-products such as biogas or compost. The collection and transportation of waste to recycling facilities enables recycling and material recovery.

For WtE, quantitative criteria related to energy efficiency and bottom ash recovery are established.\n\n# Traffic Light Criteria\n\n# Green\n\nThe activity complies with the following criteria:\n\n- Collection and transportation of non-hazardous waste that is segregated at source or at an intermediate sorting facility that is intended for preparation for reuse or recycling operations, and\n- Includes waste collection containers, transfer stations, transportation vehicles and other related infrastructure.\n\n# Amber\n\nThe activity complies with the following criteria:\n\n- Collection and transportation of non-hazardous waste for energy recovery directly without any material recovery for recycling, and\n- Includes waste collection equipment and other related infrastructure.\n\n# Ineligible\n\nThe activity complies with the following criteria:\n\n- Collection and transportation of non-hazardous waste directly for disposal to landfills, and\n- Does not include adequate equipment for collections and transportation.\n\nWe note here that in Singapore’s context, waste is first sent for incineration, and the incineration ash is subsequently landfilled together with non-incinerable waste. Landfilling of waste with methane capture has been included here as it provides guidance for such projects at the regional level.\n\nFor WtE plants, the net thermal efficiency of the plants is expected to be above 25% and the bottom ash recovery of metal is expected to be at least 75% for Green classification, as this ensures net GHG emissions through enhanced energy recovery. Similarly, the green criteria for Material recovery facilities is expected to be above 50%, so as to have significant material recovery that can foster a sustainable waste value chain, with economically feasible and environmentally supportive recycling sector. The 50% efficiency in intermediate sorting also prevents majority of waste entering the landfill and allows for net GHG emission reductions.\n\n# TSC overview and methodology\n\nThe criteria for the sector considers the waste management hierarchy to ensure adequate management of the MSW by prioritising recycling over energy recovery or landfilling. Separation at source or at an intermediate facility are promoted to enhance recovery and recycling, as well as lower GHG emissions.\n\nET W\n",

Investment in water sector is pivotal to building climate resilience across sectors and strengthening international peace and security. The World Bank estimates that sustained negative growth will occur in some regions due to water related losses in agriculture, health, income and property (World Bank, 2016).\n\nWater and energy use are also highly correlated. Reducing leakages and increasing energy efficiency are also important to meeting climate mitigation goals. This is particularly important in the desalination process which is energy intensive or where water is transported over great distances. For example, in California, the water system uses approximately 20% of the state’s electricity and 30% of its natural gas to pump, convey, treat, and heat water75.\n\nAt the same time, poor access to safe drinking water and sanitation can lead to innumerable premature deaths and negatively affect a region’s economy. The activities within the water sector for a sustainable finance Taxonomy shall primarily involve processes for efficient design of water collection, treatment, supply and wastewater treatment, with specific focus on increasing energy efficiency and reducing leakage losses.\n\nIn Singapore, current water demand is 440 million gallons per day (mgd). This is set to almost double by 2065, with the non-domestic sector being the major source of demand growth, increasing from about half of our total water consumption today to about two-thirds by 2065. The increase in water demand would be met by the installation, upgrading and effective operation of NEWater, desalination plants and distribution network (PUB, 2022).\n\nIn Singapore, rainwater and used water are collected and conveyed through separate systems, ensuring that our waterways are free of pollution. Rainwater collected in local catchment areas is stored in 17 reservoirs and treated at our local waterworks to produce potable water. It is then distributed through 6,600km of pipeline network to both households and industries.\n\nUsed water is collected via 3,600km of public sewers and deep tunnel sewerage systems and is sent to the four water reclamation plants for treatment (PUB, 2022). The treated used water effluent is further purified using advanced membrane technologies and ultra-violet disinfection to produce NEWater at NEWater plants. Singapore also has desalination plants which produce potable water.\n\nSingapore is a compact city state that is highly urbanised and densely populated. Singapore has the third highest population density in the world at 8,377 people/km2 and is one of the most water stressed countries in the world due to a lack of land to store and capture rainfall. Hence, the operating conditions of water and wastewater treatment infrastructure face unique challenges such as urbanised watershed as well as the lack of space for water infrastructure and deployment of renewable energy sources.\n\nCompeting land use compels Singapore to build deeper or multi-storey plants. For example, the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS) project allows used water to be conveyed by gravity to centralised water reclamation plants and frees up some 880 hectares of land for higher value land use. However, this necessitates the construction of deeper Influent Pumping Stations (IPS) to pump used water from some 50-60m deep to the treatment processes in the centralised water reclamation plants.\n\nOver the years, PUB has developed NEWater and desalinated seawater as two additional National Taps to enhance Singapore’s water resilience. Technological advancement, such as Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) has made wastewater treatment processes more land efficient.\n\n75 https://www.ppic.org/publication/water-and-energy-in-california/\n",

In addition, MBR produces treated effluent that is of much better quality than that required to meet local discharge standards, and consistent and reliable supply of NEWater. In the context of NEWater production in Singapore, MBR also allows the overall treatment efficiency of water reuse to be improved, as the conventional treatment processes in a WRP and a NEWater Factory are shortened by two processes, saving both land and treatment costs.\n\nThe activities in water sector for Singapore have been defined as follows:\n\n- Plants: Construction, extension and operation of new water collection and treatment systems\n- Plants: Renewal of water collection and treatment systems\n- Distribution network: Construction, extension and operation of new water collection and treatment systems\n- Distribution network: Renewal of water collection and treatment systems (distribution networks)\n- Plants: Construction, extension and operation of wastewater collection and treatment\n- Collection network: Renewal of wastewater collection and treatment\n- Plants: Desalination systems\n\nThe activities align with ISIC — Section E: Water supply, Sewerage, Waste Management and Remediation Activities.

The goal of this document is to provide a common understanding on low-carbon agricultural operations for the Singapore context as a guide for the financial sector.\n\n# Levers for reducing emissions from the agriculture sector\n\nFor the following agriculture criteria, the focus is on reducing the GHG emissions relating to agriculture. There are a number of levers available to reduce emissions from agriculture which we are trying to target through these criteria. These include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Less emission intensive crops and animal production\n- Reduced use of chemicals\n- Increased use of bio solution\n- Use of organic fertilisers\n- Use of low-carbon equipment\n- Better monitoring of environmental conditions\n- Plant breeding dedicated to achieve better yields and resilience\n\nThere are, of course, other environmental goals that are important when referring to agriculture — such as reduced leaching of chemicals etc. Where these are aligned with climate goals, they are also tackled here but they are not the focus on this phase of work.\n\nTo safeguard Singapore’s food security, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) adopts a multi-pronged approach which includes diversifying food import sources and increasing local production. SFA also takes a risk-based approach to food safety which is guided by science and consistent with international standards. SFA has in place an integrated farm-to-fork food safety system to ensure that food is safe for consumption.\n\nMore than 90% of Singapore’s food supply is imported, with only about 1% of Singapore’s land set aside for agricultural use. Given Singapore's heavy reliance on imports, a key strategy to enhance its food security is import source diversification.\n\n\n",

The local agri-food sector is predominantly made up of farms, producing hen shell eggs, vegetables, and seafood.\n\nHowever, the agri-food industry in Singapore is nascent where land and resource constraints have prompted farms to adapt technology and innovative ways to ‘grow more with less’, in a sustainable way. In consultation with the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), context was provided by SFA in terms of its work to anchor high productivity farming players in our local ecosystem. Our farms are harnessing technology and innovation to strive towards productivity, climate-resilience and resource efficiency. These farms are also able to employ climate control technologies, increasing their resilience to climate changes.\n\n# Categorisation of activities\n\n# Activity technical screening criteria\n\n| Sector           | Agriculture                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Activity         | Perennial crops (Palm (oil), coffee, cocoa, tea, rubber trees, nuts, fruits); Non-perennial crops (rice, wheat, soybeans, corn, cassava, sugar cane, sugar beet, tobacco, vegetables) includes conventional, protected and hydroponic systems |\n| ISIC Code        | A 0111, A 0112, A 0113                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ISIC Description | Perennial and non-perennial crops                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Objective        | Identify Green, Amber and Ineligible operations dedicated to the production of perennial and non-perennial crops.                                                                                                                             |\n\n# Traffic Light Criteria\n\n| Criteria   | Alignment with international best practice/taxonomies or methodologies                                                                                                            |\n| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Green      | The activity must meet one of the following criteria: Aligned to Climate Bonds Taxonomy, EU Taxonomy does not include agriculture, Colombian Taxonomy applies a similar approach. |\n| Amber      | Activities that should either be phased out or changed over a period of time.                                                                                                     |\n| Ineligible | Considered ineligible activities.                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n# Criteria for Protected Agriculture and Water Infrastructure for best practices\n\n- Agricultural equipment powered by renewable energy; or\n- Agriculture equipment that appears amongst the most resource efficient in the country e.g. in terms of electricity, water, land, labour efficiency; or\n- Low-carbon crop management: regenerative agriculture, organic farming, precision agriculture, agroforestry, controlled environments, as certified by eligible schemes (see list aside).\n- Use of organic and biofertilisers; or\n- Use of physical and biocontrol of pathogens, pests and weeds; or\n- Nurseries related to low-carbon crop management; or\n- Adoption and maintenance of monitoring and tracking technology (with the goal of enhancing predictability and precision in agricultural operation, and thus being a resilience and adaptation measure); or\n- Use of superior inputs which enables production with less resources e.g. superior seeds obtained through plant breeding (conventional breeding and genetic engineering with focus on productivity and resilience).\n\n# TSC overview and methodology\n\nDue to the diverse characteristics of agricultural operations, the approach to identifying green agricultural practices and activities does not easily lend itself to quantitative metrics and/or thresholds. Instead, it classifies activities and sub-activities according to the “traffic light” methodology where green are activities that are encouraged, amber are activities that should either be phased out or changed over a period of time, while the rest are considered ineligible activities. This approach is similar to the one used for the construction of the Colombian Taxonomy.\n\nEach bullet on the list represents a credible certification scheme most adapted to certify one or more activities listed on the left column (e.g. sugarcane production — Bonsucro certification scheme). Eligible Green activities should adopt guidelines from one or more of the listed schemes.\n\nEach bullet on the list is eligible on its own unless otherwise stated. The sunset date for Amber activities under the Agriculture sector will be until 2030 unless stated otherwise. New projects/measures are eligible under the Amber category.\n\nNote: that there is currently very limited guidance on protected agriculture around the world, criteria may be used as a proxy until additional guidance becomes available.\n\n\n",

    "text": "\nTaxonomy in Practice\n\n# Preamble\n\nA key principle of this Taxonomy is that of the interoperability with other regional and national taxonomies. Capital is global, as are capital market participants, and it is therefore important that the Taxonomy is both consistent and compatible with other taxonomies, particularly the EU Taxonomy and the ASEAN Taxonomy. In drafting the Taxonomy, the approach, metrics and language adopted should be similar to other taxonomies. In particular, the structural underpinnings of this Taxonomy will be seen to be largely consistent with the EU Taxonomy.\n\nWhile the Taxonomy represents current thinking around climate, transition, and activity thresholds, it is not designed to be static. It is not only permissible, but also desirable, that the Taxonomy be iterated in the future to reflect new initiatives and understandings, particularly in regard to the thresholds used for transition. Thresholds that are viewed as appropriate in this version may be less appropriate in years to come, and as such periodic updates will be necessary.\n\n# Mandatory use of the Taxonomy\n\nIt is important to note that the Taxonomy is not mandatory or contained in any regulation at the time of publishing. It is intended to be voluntary for use in the first years as adoption grows. The following sections outline how the Taxonomy could be used by different users now and in the future.\n\n# Users of the Taxonomy\n\nBy business line: it is anticipated that Singapore-based Financial Institutions providing debt and/or equity capital, including both public and private capital, would be the primary users of the Taxonomy; while it can also be used by companies, regulators, policymakers, and other financial market participants that need to define green activities.\n\n# Primary Users: Financial Market Participants\n\na. Financial Institutions: These are intended as the primary users of the Taxonomy and include equity fund management, debt fund management, alternative investment management, private equity, venture capital, infrastructure financing, investment-linked insurance products, among others (see full list below).\n\nWhile these would be the primary, direct users of the Taxonomy, the ultimate end “users” would be the clients of the Financial Institutions outlined above. The Taxonomy is designed to assist in their decision making when allocating capital to financial institutions, investment funds and other vehicles that are aligned with their overall environmental objectives and the long-term development of a green, sustainable economy.\n\n# Secondary Users: Companies, Industry Regulators and Policymakers\n\na. Companies: Companies can use the Taxonomy to help align their businesses to green economic activities, which may help them access green financing opportunities, bring sustainable investment opportunities to the market, and/or help them in their investment decisions. Taxonomy reporting can also be harmonised with reporting for other frameworks, including TCFD, CDP, and SBTi, to provide a comprehensive assessment of a company’s performance on sustainability and environmental objectives.\n\nb. Financial Service Providers: The Taxonomy can also be used by providers of services.\n\n83 This geographic scope would refer to the nexus of operations, rather than strict issuer-driven geographic classification. For example, entities incorporated in Cayman but with substantial or an overwhelming majority of operations in ASEAN would be covered.\n\n\n",

Performance against the technical screening criteria, or environmental management data where this is an acceptable proxy for compliance with the technical screening criteria – including DNSH assessment;\n\nc. Management data on social issues: Labour rights policies, management systems, audits, reporting.\n\nWhile the Taxonomy is not mandated for any institutions at the time of publishing, Financial Institutions can use it to report on the degree to which their investments, products or range of transactions (in the case of single loans, etc.) are aligned with the Taxonomy and the environmental objectives to which the undertaking contributes.\n\nIn doing so, the Financial Institution can assess the alignment (or percentage alignment) of the activity or issuer being financed, aggregate these alignments to the portfolio or product level, and disclose aggregate alignment accordingly.\n\nAt present, there is limited company disclosure on the breakdown of a company’s revenue, capital expenditures and operating expenditures by activity level and, by extension, its alignment with the Taxonomy technical screening criteria. Additional company disclosure will therefore be required to determine an issuers’ actual alignment with the overall environmental objectives and threshold.\n\n# Table 17 — Users and Uses of the Taxonomy\n\n| Primary user                | Asset Managers                                                                                                                                             | Financial institutions and asset managers that provide financial products that are aligned with Taxonomy activities, including retail and institutional fund offerings, savings products and pensions.                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|                             | a.

The ISIC system has been selected as a starting point for the Taxonomy development as it is comprehensive in its coverage of economic sectors worldwide. It is acknowledged that many financial market participants use other classification systems, such as the Global Industry Classification System (GICS) or Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB), and a mapping of alternative classification systems to the selected ISIC sectors will be provided.\n\n# Definitions\n\n# What is an activity?\n\na. An activity refers to an economic activity as categorised using the UN ISIC framework.\n\nWhen a company offers goods or services, it is performing an economic activity. The universe of economic activities is described using ISIC codes, which cover 21 broad sectors and with four further levels of differentiation. At the fourth level, 615 classes of economic activity are identified. The ISIC codes map directly to the EU’s NACE classification system. Any economic activities that are not directly covered by ISIC codes, such as buildings, have been identified as a cross-cutting activity for both climate change mitigation and adaptation, in line with the EU Taxonomy.\n\n# What is revenue?\n\nRevenue or net turnover means the amounts derived from the sale of products and the provision of services after deducting sales rebates and value added tax and other taxes directly linked to turnover. Overall turnover is equivalent to a firm’s total revenues over a defined period. Turnover ratios are used by financial analysts to understand a company’s efficiency and profitability based on data found in financial statements.\n\n# What is CapEx?\n\nCapital expenditure (CapEx) is a payment for goods or services recorded, or capitalised, on the balance sheet instead of expensed on the income statement.\n\nUse: Aside from helping investors analyse a company’s investment in its existing and new fixed assets, capital expenditures can give an indication of a company’s strategy for improving environmental performance and resilience.\n\n# What is OpEx?\n\nOperating expenses (OpEx) are shorter-term expenses required to meet the ongoing operational costs of running a business.\n\n# Green, Amber &#x26; Ineligible activities classification\n\nThe chapter of the Taxonomy on Classification deals in more detail with the way that green, amber and ineligible activities should be assessed in the context of alignment and the technical screening criteria. This Taxonomy by design allows for capital to be deployed in a way that recognises the differing economic, social, and technological contexts of ASEAN member states, and acknowledges that capital being deployed to make substantial (but alone insufficient) progress towards a desired end-state is both legitimate and desirous.\n\n# Step by step guide\n\n- An assessment of the activity or issuer being financed.\n- Three tiers of assessment: activity, project, and company/issuer (please refer to Definitions box for more detail).\n\n# Footnotes\n\n84See: https://www.oecd.org/corporate/mne/\n\n85 See: https://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/conventions-and-recommendations/lang--en/index.htm\n\n86International standard industrial classification of all economic activities (ISIC), developed by the United Nations Statistics Division. https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/Econ/ISIC.cshtml\n\nE C I T C A R P  N I  Y M O N O X A T\n\n",

As such, activities, projects and a company/issuer can only currently be classified as being aligned with climate change mitigation, although DNSH criteria should be considered for all of the remaining four Environmental Objectives. DNSH requirements are detailed in its own chapter.\n\n# Economic Activity Eligibility and Alignment\n\nEligibility under the Taxonomy is assessed by economic activity according to its ISIC Classification (see Appendices for more details). Economic activities will be classed as ‘Ineligible’ under the Taxonomy if the economic activity does not fall within the scope of the Taxonomy.\n\n• Determine the extent to which the company/issuer’s activities fall within one of the target sectors;\n\n• Assess the proportion of revenue (or CapEx/OpEx) that is aligned with one (or more) of the Environmental Objectives; and then\n\n• Disclose as best practice that the company/issuer’s activities that are aligned with the Taxonomy DNSH criteria or minimum social safeguards.\n\n• If the eligible activity is not aligned with the Green technical screening criteria, then the activity is assessed against the amber, or transition, technical screening criteria and, if it also does no significant harm to the other four environmental objectives, can be considered to be aligned as an amber, or transition, activity under the Taxonomy.\n\n• Eligible activities which are aligned with either the Green or Amber technical screening criteria. Users are recommended to provide disclosure against DNSH tests and to prepare for DNSH requirements should they be mandatory in the future. In the future, a breach of the DNSH requirements for the remaining four environmental objectives will result in the activity being classified as Ineligible under the Taxonomy.\n\n• Taxonomy-aligned Revenues represents the proportion of the net turnover derived from products or services that are from activities that are aligned with the Green or Amber technical screening criteria for at least one of the six environmental objectives of the Taxonomy.\n\n• Taxonomy-aligned CapEx represents the proportion of the capital expenditure of an activity that is either already Taxonomy-aligned or is part of a credible plan to extend or reach Taxonomy alignment.\n\n• Taxonomy-aligned OpEx represents the proportion of the operating expenditure associated with taxonomy-aligned activities.\n\nAfter constructing a portfolio of investments, financial institutions would aggregate this information to a portfolio level, using this information to determine (and disclose) how much of a product is aligned with the Taxonomy.\n\nWhilst regulatory activity is not within scope of this Taxonomy, one outcome could be that regulators provide thresholds for alignment, whereby portfolios with a green alignment greater than x% would be permitted to identify as a “green” product, but those with an alignment lower than x% would not.\n\n\n",

One additional outcome of the Taxonomy as discussed earlier is that regulators consider incorporating mandatory regulatory disclosures that are aligned with and would facilitate consideration of Taxonomy alignment.\n\nWhere an economic activity does not meet the technical screening criteria for Green or Amber, then the activity will, by default, be classed as ineligible as this is neither currently aligned with a low-carbon economy or has a transition pathway to alignment.\n\nEconomic activities will be classed as ‘Ineligible’ under the Taxonomy if the economic activity does not fall within the scope of the Taxonomy.\n\n# Taxonomy Reporting Recommendations/Expectations in Practice\n\nAt present, the Taxonomy is only considering the first environmental objective, climate change mitigation, with subsequent environmental objectives to follow in future iterations of the Taxonomy. This means promoting activities that are already low carbon or can contribute to a transition to a low-carbon economy. Under this assessment, the recommended reporting elements are as follows:\n\n# Green Activities\n\nWhere the issuer is reporting alignment with an activity determined to be Green, the issuer should describe (both quantitatively and qualitatively) how the activity meets the technical screening criteria for climate change mitigation, any external verification or due diligence of these metrics, and the level of associated revenue/turnover.\n\n# Do No Significant Harm\n\nTo be classed as aligned, an economic activity has to meet the technical screening criteria for that activity. It is also recommended for all users of the Taxonomy to provide disclosures about how DNSH requirements are met (or not met).\n\nThe DNSH assessment is to ensure that, at the same time as an economic activity or project is making a substantial contribution to one of the five Environmental Objectives under the Taxonomy, it is not doing so through practices or policies which would cause potential or actual harm to any of the other four Environmental Objectives.\n\nWhile compliance with the DNSH tests are not compulsory in the early implementation of the Taxonomy, in the future this may be required so that if there is no identifiable approach or option to mitigate this potential harm, then the activity will be classed as ‘ineligible’ under the Taxonomy.\n\nE C I T C A R P  N I  Y M O N O X A T\n",

Investors are expected to continually monitor indicators and engage with issuers to understand the way that materiality, probability and risk management have evolved. Investors should also remain apprised of new and emerging risks to the issuer.\n\n# Minimum Social Safeguards\n\nThe Taxonomy establishes certain minimum safeguards that are applicable to all assessments – investors should determine that the issuer is compliant with the OECD Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, with specific reference to the ILO Core Labour Conventions.\n\n# Case Studies\n\n# Case study: Off-shore wind farm, equity financed\n\nOff-shore wind energy is considered to make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation by providing zero-emissions energy and are classified as Green under the Taxonomy. Company A makes 20% of its revenue from off-shore wind farms and 80% of its revenue from thermal coal-fired power stations.\n\n# Case study: Freight transportation, equity financed\n\nFreight transportation currently accounts for a significant proportion of carbon emissions from transportation in Singapore and the wider ASEAN region so reducing tailpipe emissions from this source.\n\n# Case study: Construction of new buildings, debt financed\n\nConstruction of energy and resource efficient new buildings can make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation by reducing GHG emissions from the operational and construction.\n\n# Financial institution portfolio reporting:\n\nThe electric-powered transportation activity automatically falls under the green classification. The Financial Institution then should take steps to satisfy itself that the company does not breach the DNSH tests on pollution and the circular economy to classify this company’s activity as Green under the Taxonomy.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIt is envisaged that some criteria and methods outlined in this Taxonomy will need periodic revision, while other areas could entail further progression subject to industry development and technology advancement down the road. There could also be changes on the economic activities in and out of scope as transition moves along. The Taxonomy would allow monitoring capital flows towards sustainable finance and facilitate greater growth of green finance in Singapore and the broader ASEAN region.\n\n87See: https://www.oecd.org/corporate/mne/\n\n88See: https://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/conventions-and-recommendations/lang--en/index.htm\n\n89See: http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/OECD-Due-Diligence-Guidance-for-Responsible-Business-Conduct.pdf\n\n90See: http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/OECD-Due-Diligence-Guidance-for-Responsible-Business-Conduct.pdf, p15\n\n",

ISO 13.060: Water Quality).\n- State ambition to maximise recycling at end of life based on waste management plans, dismantling/decommissioning processes at time of decommissioning (e.g. through contractual agreements with recycling partners, reflection in financial projections or official project documentation), aligned to international standards and guidelines (ex: KAPSARC Guide to circular economy, French standard, XP X30-901, Circular economy – Circular economy project management system).\n\nEnsure that the following conditions are met based on ground evidence:\n\n- All practical steps are taken to mitigate the impacts.\n- The project has been recognised of overriding public interest and/or it is proven that the benefits of the project outweigh its impacts.\n- There are no significantly environmentally better option.\n- The project does not show significant adverse impact on upstream or downstream water bodies.\n- This applies to newly built hydropower and extension of existing hydropower.\n\nConstruction of new hydropower should not lead to increase fragmentation of rivers, consequently refurbishment of existing hydropower plant and rehabilitation of existing barriers should be prioritised. Construction of small hydropower (&#x3C;10MW) should be avoided.\n\nDuring operation:\n\n- All necessary mitigation measures should be implemented to reach good ecological status or potential, in particular regarding ecological continuity and ecological flow. Priority should be given to nature-based solutions.\n- Aligned to IFC’s and World Bank Group’s environmental and social standards.\n\nGeneral impact: Operation of the hydropower plant must adhere to the principles of the UNECE Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary, Watercourses and International Lakes.\n\nMR A H T N A C I F I N I N G I S O N O D\n",

This includes inter alia, terrestrial habitat alteration, loss of valuable ecosystem, land consumption, overburden disposal, negative effects on biodiversity, emissions of particles and NOx, noise and hazardous materials.\n- For the operation of the district heating networks, potential significant impacts are considered low.

protecting biodiversity/eco-systems have been implemented (i.e. avoid fragmentation of ecosystems and hydrological and hydrogeological regimes, affecting species migration pathways). • For sites/operations located in or near to biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), as well as other protected areas), ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 6) – based on the conservation objectives of the protected area. • For such sites/operations, ensure that: ○ a site-level biodiversity management plan exists and is implemented in alignment with the IFC Performance Standard 6; ○ all necessary mitigation measures are in place to reduce the impacts on species and habitats; ○ a robust, appropriately designed and long-term biodiversity monitoring and evaluation programme exists and is implemented. |\n| Pollution prevention and control                 | • Ensure emissions to air, water and soil are prevented/minimized as per international standards and guidelines.

                          |\n| Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity      | - Infrastructure for low carbon transport is land use intensive and is a major factor of ecosystem deterioration and biodiversity loss. Projects should ensure that:\n- Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with national and international standards (e.g IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks; Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) Voluntary guidelines on biodiversity-inclusive impact assessment).\n- Such impact assessments should, at the very least, identify, evaluate, and mitigate any potential negative impacts of the designated activities, projects, or assets on ecosystems and its biodiversity.\n- Invasive plants are appearing very often along transport infrastructure and are sometimes even spread due to transport infrastructure, which might negatively impact natural ecosystems (e.g. natural fauna). Care should be taken not to spread any invasive plants through proper maintenance.\n- Wildlife collisions is a problem and should be considered. Solutions developed for should be applied for the detection and avoidance of potential traps that may cause the unnecessary death of animals.\n- Mitigation options exist and different types of measures can be beneficial for wildlife, such as:\n* Wildlife warning systems combined with heat sensors can reduce the number of collisions.\n* Fences along areas with high strike risk.\n* Viaducts, tunnels, overpasses and bridges, etc.\n* Warning signals that are triggered by approaching traffic, particularly in areas of high strike risk. |\n| Pollution prevention and control                 | * Minimise noise and vibrations from use of infrastructure by introducing open trenches/wall barriers/other measures and comply with national and international standards. (Ex: ISO/TS 21929-2, Sustainability in building construction – Sustainability indicators – Part 2: Framework for the development of indicators for civil engineering works).\n* Minimise noise, dust, emissions pollution during construction/maintenance works.\n* Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Promote resource resilience and circular economy | - Re-use parts and use recycled material during the renewal, upgrade and construction of infrastructure.\n- At least 80% (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and demolition waste (excluding naturally occurring material) generated on the construction site must be prepared for re-use, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling operations using waste to substitute other materials.\n- Activities aligned with international standards. Ex: ISO 20887:2020 – Sustainability in buildings and civil engineering works.\n- Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented as per international standards and guidelines.

Manufacture of hydrogen\n\n# Do no significant harm assessment\n\nThe main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from manufacture of hydrogen is, in practical terms, inseparable from the potential for significant harm created by the hydrocarbon refining activity more generally and is associated with:\n\n- polluting emissions to air (in the case of hydrogen production via electrolysis, there is an indirect environmental impact associated with the generation of electricity);\n- water used for cooling might lead to local resource depletion, dependent of the local scarcity of water resources; and\n- the generation of wastes (e.g. spent catalysts and by-products of the various physical and chemical treatment processes used in purifying the hydrogen produced via hydrocarbon processing).\n\n# 4.5. Manufacture of aluminium\n\n# Do no significant harm assessment\n\nThe main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from manufacture of aluminium is associated with:\n\n- the potential for significant air emission impacts: perfluorocarbons, fluoride gases, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and particulate matter (e.g. unused cryolite). Hydrogen fluorides can be toxic to vegetation;\n- the toxic, corrosive and reactive nature of waste generated by the used linings (cathodes) from the electrolytic cells (known as spent pot lining (SPL)). Dissolved fluorides and cyanides from the SPL material can create significant environmental impacts including groundwater contamination and pollution of local watercourses;\n- the ability (or lacking thereof) of aluminium manufacturing plants to incorporate aluminium scrap (including scrap from their own manufacturing processes) in the production process; and the potential to impact ecosystems as a result of the land footprint of the site and from polluting emissions.\n\n# Objectives\n\n# Climate change adaptation\n\n- Refer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation: Table 18.\n- Also, can refer to ISO Standard for Adaptation to climate change: ISO 14091:2021 — Guidelines on vulnerability, impacts and risk assessment.\n\n# Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity\n\n- Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with national and international standards (e.g IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks; Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) Voluntary guidelines on biodiversity-inclusive impact assessment)) – including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations.\n- Ensure any required mitigation measures for protecting biodiversity/eco-systems have been implemented.\n- For sites/operations located in or near to biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), as well as other protected areas), ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 6) – based on the conservation objectives of the protected area.\n- For such sites/operations, ensure that:\n\n# Pollution prevention and control\n\n- Ensure emissions to air (e.g. sulphur dioxide - SO2, nitrogen oxide - NOx, particulate matter, Total Organic Carbon (TOC), dioxins, mercury (Hg), hydrogen chloride (HCL), hydrogen fluoride (HF), Total Fluoride, and (PFCs) polyfluorinated hydrocarbons (PFCs)) are prevented / minimised as per international and national standards Ex: IFC EHS Guidelines: Air emissions and ambient air quality; ISO 14001:2015 Environmental management systems — Requirements with guidance for use; Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM); ISO 11014:2009(en) Safety data sheet for chemical products).\n- A minimum requirement is the implementation and adherence to a recognised environmental management system (ISO 14001, EMAS, or equivalent).\n- Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level.\n\n# Promote resource resilience and circular economy\n\n- Where manufacture of hydrogen takes place within the context of an oil and gas refining installation, ensure appropriate measures are in place to minimise and manage waste and material use in accordance with international standards and guidelines for the Refining of Mineral Oil and Gas (ex: KAPSARC Guide to circular economy, French standard, XP X30-901, Circular economy – Circular economy project management system; ISO/TC 323 (In development Scenario 2); ISO/AWI 59014: Secondary materials — Principles, sustainability and traceability requirements; Global Recycled Standard (GRS): is a voluntary product standard for tracking and verifying the content of recycled materials in a final product.; ETP Clean Energy Technology Guide).\n- Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented as per international standards and guidelines (ex: UNEP International Water Quality Guidelines for Ecosystems (IWQGES); ISO 13.060: Water Quality).\n- In order to avoid risks to circular economy, aluminium manufacturing plants need to be able to process aluminium scrap. In order to avoid unnecessary resource and energy consumption, the aluminium scrap collection and sorting activities should be optimised for separation on an alloy specific basis. If scrap alloys are mixed, the functionality of the recycled material is restricted, and valuable alloying elements may be lost.\n\nMR A H T N A C I F I N I N G I S O N O D\n",

and biodiversity      | - Take measures to ensure sustained or improved long term conservation status at the landscape level.\n- In designated conservation areas, actions should be demonstrated to be in line with the conservation objectives for those areas.\n- No conversion of habitats specifically sensitive to biodiversity loss or of high conservation value such as grasslands and any high carbon stock area (e.g. peat lands and wetlands), and areas set aside for the restoration of such habitats in line with national legislation.\n- Develop a forest management plan (or equivalent) that includes provisions for maintaining biodiversity.\n- Evaluate the ecosystem service provision with the aim to not decrease the amount and quality of ecosystem services provided.\n- Forests are monitored and protected to prevent illegal logging, in compliance with national laws.\n- Promote close-to-nature forestry or similar concepts depending on the local requirements and limitations.\n- Select native species or species, varieties, ecotypes and provenance of trees that adequately provide the necessary resilience to climate change, natural disasters and the biotic, pedologic and hydrologic condition of the area concerned, as well as the potential invasive character of the species under local conditions, current and projected climate change.\n- Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with national and international standards (e.g IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks; Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) Voluntary guidelines on biodiversity-inclusive impact assessment)) – including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations. |\n| Pollution prevention and control

grasslands and any high carbon stock area (e.g. peat lands and wetlands), and areas set aside for the restoration of such habitats in line with national legislation.\n\n- Develop a forest management plan (or equivalent) that includes provisions for maintaining biodiversity.\n\n- Evaluate the ecosystem service provision with the aim to not decrease the amount and quality of ecosystem services provided.\n\n- Forests are monitored and protected to prevent illegal logging, in compliance with national laws.\n\n- Promote close-to-nature forestry or similar concepts depending on the local requirements and limitations.\n\n- Select native species or species, varieties, ecotypes and provenance of trees that adequately provide the necessary resilience to climate change, natural disasters and the biotic, pedologic and hydrologic condition of the area concerned, as well as the potential invasive character of the species under local conditions, current and projected climate change.\n\n- Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with national and international standards (e.g IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks; Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) Voluntary guidelines on biodiversity-inclusive impact assessment) – including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations.\n\n- For sites/operations located in or near to biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), as well as other protected areas), ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 6) – based on the conservation objectives of the protected area.\n\n- For such sites/operations, ensure that:\n\n* a site-level biodiversity management plan exists and is implemented in alignment with the IFC Performance Standard 6;\n* all necessary mitigation measures are in place to reduce the impacts on species and habitats;\n* a robust, appropriately designed and long-term biodiversity monitoring and evaluation programme exists and is implemented. |\n| Pollution prevention and control                 | * Minimise the use of pesticides and favour alternative approaches or techniques, such as

    "text": "\nAppendix H\n# Sectoral Decarbonisation Approach (SDA)\n\nAs a basis for initial planning, we recommend the use of the IEA RTS, IEA 2DS and IPCC SR1.5-aligned models at the global scale for their robustness and the accessibility of their data. These global scenarios may be updated for future planning and refinement when more data becomes available to policymakers.\n\n# Business-As-Usual (BAU) and Mitigation Scenarios\n\nWe recommend use of the SDA, a widely adopted methodology used by the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) and the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). The degree of intervention is the difference between projected BAU trajectory and carbon mitigation scenarios. Here, we choose a takeoff point of 2019 as the latest year of audited statistical data.\n\n# Input specific to Singapore\n\nIn applying the SDA, we must localise the models with Singapore-specific and sector-specific data input. To this purpose, we draw on the public-access and credible datasets at the highest resolution available.\n\n# Data Hierarchy\n\nGovernment-sourced datasets (i.e. from the Department of Statistics, contributing agencies and publications on national strategy) are preferred over data collated by NGOs or thinktanks. Time series data is preferred over single-year snapshot data quoted in documents. Where able, we have also cross-compared data presented in different publications (e.g. energy and emissions from Singapore’s National Communications and associated reporting to the UNFCCC) to ensure robustness.\n\nFor forward projections on economic and sector activity, at the macro-level we use GDP projections in line with government planning norms. Where this is not available (such as for the 2030–2050 window), we take reference from regional growth projections consistent with global scenarios. Sector-specific projections are discussed in the following sections.\n\n# Electricity generation sector\n\nActivity. This is expressed in terms of megawatt-hours (MWh) generated. The strong positive correlation between GDP (as a proxy for economic activity) and electricity demand is well-documented across world economies, and also holds true for Singapore. Although energy efficiency measures have decreased the slope of consumption relative to activity, the correlation coefficient is approx. 0.99. We may therefore model future electricity consumption for Singapore based on GDP projection estimates up to 2050.\n\nEmissions Intensity. The carbon intensity of Singapore’s electricity generation is directly related to its fuel mix for energy generation, which is currently dominated by the use of natural gas. Historically, since liberalisation of the energy market in the late 1990s, natural gas has grown in usage driven purely by market forces and has equilibrated to account for ~80-90% of electricity generation. This has been incorporated into models.\n\nDownstream implications. Electricity is a source of secondary emissions in the Buildings and Transport sectors, and the emissions intensity from has been held consistent in these end-use sectors.\n\nWhile there may be a large array of scenarios tabled by agencies, thinktanks and academia, they are fundamentally premised on suites of models that encompass economic activity, energy usage, greenhouse gas emissions and climate effects. They are not meant to be used as hard predictions/forecasts, but as guide rails for possible outcomes shaped by policy, economic and technological changes in the decades ahead.\n\n94The SDA method was developed by a partnership comprising CDP, WRI &#x26; WWF under the Science Based Targets initiative, with technical support from Ecofys. 95Energy-Emissions models and Integrated Assessment Models.\n",

Even more rarely addressed is the issue of Just Transition, following the UNFCCC’s definition, understood as transition that enables “transformation of the economy and economic system in a way that is as fair and inclusive as possible to everyone concerned, creating decent work opportunities and leaving no one behind”.122\n\nThe global effort to incorporate transition dimension into taxonomies and frameworks does not yet entirely account for assets, such as coal power plants, that pose significant harm to climate objectives, or address the phase-out process. Importantly, in its recent report,123 the EU Platform on Sustainable Finance explicitly recommends developing technical screening criteria for potential decommissioning/closure of assets that do not have technological possibility of transitioning away from significantly harmful performance levels.124 Similarly, GFANZ recommends development of criteria for credible coal phaseout.125\n\n# Context\n\nIEA’s 2021 report indicated that, to be aligned with a 1.5°C scenario, about 100GW of coal-fired plants need to be phased out during 2021-2030, from both developed and emerging economies.121\n\nFor coal to green transition the challenge is dual: the focus is not just on scaling-up already zero-emission solutions, but also on how to quickly phase out coal. To date, this phase-out thinking is absent in the green finance discussions despite the vital role it has to play in reducing global emissions.\n\nMore countries commit to coal phase-out: at COP26, more than 40 economies from both developed and developing countries and more recently, according to Powering Past Coal Alliance, nearly 50 governments pledged to phase out coal; however, not all are fully aligned with the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, where all OECD countries need to phase out coal by 2030, and the rest of the world by 2040.\n\n…but the phase-out ambition level is often questionable: in many instances, coal retirement pledges refer to plants that operate at or near the end of their full life span, those already sitting idle or long overdue for decommissioning. The challenge is to align the ambition of the 1.5°C objective with an actionable strategy required to fast-track the decommissioning and retirement of the plants that still have a long remaining operational lifetime and remain economically competitive, which could be due to lock in of long-term contracts.\n\n# Innovative climate finance tools\n\nInnovative climate finance tools, often labelled coal transition mechanisms (CTMs), could help to accelerate the coal to green transition: these would allow investors to wind down coal assets and their obligations, whilst placing climate change mitigation and just transition objectives at the heart of the solution.\n\nThe demand for CTMs is increasing: CTMs have gained momentum in key coal markets, ranging from securitization transactions in the U.S. to comprehensive coal transition packages such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships that have been launched and implemented in South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam for now. However, these mechanisms are still in the early stages of design; credibility and wide acceptance have yet been established by many financial institutions, agencies, and key stakeholders. There is a need for clear guidance on the credible use of climate finance to support the coal transition in the power sector to build confidence and enable the scalability of these tools.\n\n# Criteria for credible coal transition\n\nNevertheless, there is no 1.5°C-aligned, science-based classification system that is currently available to define investments eligible as climate finance under coal transition schemes. While green finance classification systems have provided some clarity in other areas, few of the already developed taxonomies or frameworks offer a robust approach towards the coal transition process. In particular, better guidance is required on what acceptable ambition levels for transition of coal assets would be and how to commit.\n\n122Implementation of just transition and economic diversification strategies: a compilation of best practices from different countries, UNFCCC (2023)\n\n123Final Report on Taxonomy extension options supporting a sustainable transition, EU Platform on Sustainable Finance (2022)\n\n124Recommendation 10.

Estimating fair value of the coal plant and emissions savings\n\nFollowing the approach devised by the Guidelines for financing a credible coal transition: A framework for assessing the climate and social outcomes of coal transition mechanisms, while comprehensive guidance on the methodologies for estimating fair value of the coal plant (a.ii) and positive absolute emissions savings (a.iii) would offer stakeholders greater clarity on how to ensure alignment with the criteria, both of these requirements are context specific and often still, at this nascent stage of CTM development, require a case by case evaluation, to determine the substantial contribution of a phase-out activity to climate change mitigation objective, it is necessary for criteria to address the following questions:\n\n- Coal plant eligibility/coal asset identification: Is it credible, from climate perspective, to provide transition finance for the given coal plant?\n- Coal transition pathways: Does the coal transition pathway proposed by the phase-out process support 1.5°C goals?\n- Social protection: Does the transaction include a strategy, plan and provisions to support a just transition? Is the phase-out activity aligned to the Just Transition principles which will address social consequences and look to provide new economic opportunities for affected communities and stakeholders?\n\n“Measuring the fair value of coal assets can be complex. Fair value assessments often incorporate current and future market and regulatory conditions, which can be subject to volatility and speculation. As a result, fair value assessments can be inherently subjective, and each valuation approach brings specific miscalculation risks. Given the benefits and misevaluation risks of different approaches, the appropriate fair value methodology will depend on market and ownership structures, and the quality and availability of financial reporting data.”\n\n“Quantitative emissions savings methodologies are an important area for future work, particularly if CTM transactions will involve results-based carbon finance or generate carbon offsets. Coal plant owners and financial institutions may also wish to provide a quantitative estimate of emissions savings to lend greater transparency to the transaction. Future work could explore whether specific emissions savings thresholds would be appropriate to lend further credibility to transactions.”\n\nSource: Climate Bonds Initiative, Climate Policy Initiative and RMI (2022), Guidelines for financing a credible coal transition: A framework for assessing the climate and social outcomes of coal transition mechanisms.\n\nTo answer these, it is necessary to devise facility level criteria to determine the level of ambition for the phase-out process, and on top of that, the entity and system level criteria that provide necessary safeguards to protect against perverse outcomes.\n\n# Early coal phase-out criteria — the Hybrid approach\n\nThe coal-fired power plant can be considered as aligned with this guidance and potentially suitable for a managed coal phase-out process, if it meets the following conditions:\n\n1. all of the facility-level criteria, and\n2. all of the entity-level criteria.\n\n# a. Facility-level criteria — the Taxonomy approach\n\nThe coal-fired power plant can be considered as aligned with the facility-level criteria if it meets all of the following requirements:\n\n1. The financial close or final investment decision of the coal plant, understood as the point in time at which all the financing agreements have been signed, has been made prior to December 2021.\n2. The fair value of the coal plant is positive at the time of the proposed coal transition. The fair value needs to be independently verified or acknowledged by internationally recognised bodies or programmes.\n3. The early coal phase-out results in positive absolute emissions savings over the expected total lifetime of the coal plant compared with a case without it. The emissions savings need to be independently verified or acknowledged by internationally recognised bodies or programmes.\n4. The phase-out of unabated coal combustion at the coal plant is aligned with, or happens earlier than 1.5°C-aligned coal phase-out deadlines. In advanced economies, this means the coal plant retires at the latest by 2030, and in other countries by 2040, in line with the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero pathway. Should a country have a national coal phase-out target that is earlier, national targets should be adhered to instead.\n\nCTMs and frameworks governing early coal phase-out processes are in the nascent stage of development. Acknowledging limitations of the proposed criteria, the document will need to be revised on a regular basis as more bodies of work become available.\n\nProposed facility and entity level criteria are thus to be valid for a limited period of time – until 2027. After 2027, a new, revised criteria accounting for new developments in the field should replace the current document. Early coal phase-out criteria will be phased out by 2035. Beyond 2030 they will be applicable only for the early phase-out of CFPPs in emerging economies.\n\n\n",

All other facility, entity and system level requirements have to be met.\n\n# Requirement a.vii\n\nWill the coal plant be retired and replaced with a portfolio of clean resources that provides equivalent electricity services?\n\n| Yes | No |\n| --- | -- |\n\n# Requirement viii\n\nThe coal plant, at a facility level as a minimum, has a just transition plan either as a separate document or as an element embedded into the Transition Plan (requirement b.iii) to mitigate impacts on key stakeholders including workers, electricity customers, and the local community. The just transition plan is designed in line with global decarbonisation commitments and, in regulated markets, planning.\n\nJust transition plan should, inter alia, require the facility owner to:\n\n1. Provide advance notice, of at least six months, or according to local laws and regulations whichever is earlier, of coal plant closure and communicate clear timelines for phase-out,\n2. Engage in stakeholder consultations and dialogues,\n3. Commit to conduct environmental and social impact assessments of the coal plant closure on its workers, direct supply chain workers, communities and ecosystem,\n4. Report on and develop plans to minimise adverse impacts on communities,\n5. Develop a worker transition plan that would support relief and reskilling opportunities to affected workers,\n6. Consider energy affordability and accessibility aspects of the early coal phase-out,\n7. Conduct remediation and reclamation.\n\n# Entity and system level criteria — the Transition Planning approach\n\nThe coal-fired power plant can be considered as aligned with the entity- and system-level criteria if it meets all of the following requirements:\n\n# Entity-level criteria:\n\nEntity level criteria apply to all actors who have shares in the given coal plant, who are planning purchase of such shares or who had such shares, which they sold, but prior to the sale benefited in any extent from the early coal phase-out scheme. New owners of the coal plant, that is a beneficiary of the early coal phase-out process, need to be aligned with the entity-level criteria and commit to maintaining compliance of the facility with the facility-level criteria.\n\n1. The coal plant owner has an entity-level commitment to no new abated and unabated coal power plant development or procurement globally, beyond their plants that have reached financial close or final investment decision by December 2021 (as per a.i.).\n2. The coal plant owner has an entity-level commitment not to establish new or extend existing fossil-fuel based Power Purchase Agreements beyond these that have been signed by December 2023.\n3. The entity has a Paris Agreement (PA)-aligned transition plan that follows the principles of transition finance outlined by International Platform on Sustainable Finance. The transition plan needs to be independently verified or acknowledged by internationally recognised bodies.\n\nExamples include: Assessing a Just Transition: Measuring the Decarbonization and Energy Transformation that Leaves No One Behind, World Benchmarking Alliance, February 2021, and Nick Robins, Translating Just Transition Ambitions into Investor Action, Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, London School of Economics, September 2021.\n\nGuidelines for a just transition towards environmentally sustainable economies and societies for all, ILO (2016).\n\nRefers to both abated and unabated coal combustion – all operations of the coal-fired power plant.

If the coal plant is retired and not replaced with a portfolio of clean resources that provides equivalent electricity services (see facility-level requirement a.vii), at least one of the following requirements set at the power system level has to be met:\n\n1. Requirement 1: 1.5°C-aligned, science-based power-sector-level decarbonisation commitments and plans at a national or sub-national level – with a boundary entailing the entire power system in which the entity operates139.

    "text": "\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis information note sets out how the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance (SAT) is being used by various market participants and the progress in its adoption since its launch in December 2023.\n\nThis information note aims to raise awareness on the different ways the SAT is being used by profiling actual applications across different user groups to date, including some that have not been publicly announced before. This note also provides detailed explanations on how different user groups can use the SAT. We hope this encourages more users to consider referencing the SAT as a complementary tool to achieve their green and transition financing objectives. This information note also highlights growth opportunities for other stakeholders such as entities in the professional services sector.\n\nA wide range of market participants including the public sector, the financial sector, the professional services sector, and real economy corporates can reference or align with the SAT green and transition criteria to originate green and transition financing instruments, and use it as a reference tool when developing internal decarbonisation strategies. (Details in Section 2)\n\nIn just over a year since its launch, the SAT has been adopted by various banks and corporates. Financial products have been developed based on the thresholds and criteria of the SAT, sustainable finance frameworks across banks and corporates have been aligned with or have made reference to the SAT criteria, and some corporates’ decarbonisation plans have also been guided by the SAT. (Details in Section 3 and 4)\n\nBroadly,\n\n- Singapore’s three local banks (DBS, OCBC, UOB) have either completed or are in the process of updating their sustainable financing frameworks to integrate the SAT. Moving forward, the banks will be using the SAT as a key reference tool in the structuring of green and transition financing solutions.\n- A number of other banks will be using the SAT as a key reference document for evaluating transition finance eligibility for assets booked in Singapore. Other banks plan to use the SAT as an additional assessment tool alongside other taxonomies or market standards when evaluating green and transition financing solutions.\n- Several corporates, such as Green Esteel and OUE Limited, have referenced the SAT to structure their sustainable financing solutions. In September 2024, OUE Limited was also the first corporate to issue a green bond which is aligned with the SAT, where the bond’s proceeds are allocated to green projects that are aligned with the SAT green activity thresholds.\n\nCollaboration between financial institutions and the broader ecosystem will be crucial to enhance the taxonomy’s adoption and effectiveness. The Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA) is driving several initiatives to support the application of the SAT. These efforts will help to promote a deeper understanding of the SAT’s activities while enhancing transparency and consistency. (Details in Section 5)\n\n\n",

    "text": "\nSINGAPORE - ASIA TAXONOMY AND ITS APPLICATION FOR THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND CORPORATES\n\n# 1 — Background of the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance\n\nTaxonomies provide clear and science-based definitions for eligible corporate activities that can be considered as green and transition, and can help channel investments and financing towards green and transition projects. Green activities in the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance (SAT) are defined as activities that are operating near zero emissions or are on a 1.5 degree-aligned pathway, while transition activities are defined as those moving towards a green transition pathway within a defined time frame or are facilitating significant emissions reduction in the short term.\n\nTaxonomies can help mitigate concerns of greenwashing when green and transition financial instruments are structured. When aligned with other international sustainability standards and made interoperable with global taxonomies, this can further enable cross-border financing and investments towards green and transition projects. In addition, taxonomies’ transition activity criteria should also take into account country or regional differences, such as the differing pace of decarbonisation and advancement or availability of technologies in the country or region.\n\nIn December 2023, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the world’s first multi-sector transition taxonomy, the SAT. The SAT was launched after four rounds of public consultation and sets out clear, science-based thresholds and criteria for defining green and transition activities in Asia that substantially contribute to climate change mitigation. The SAT scopes in activities across eight sectors that are responsible for 90% of ASEAN’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and over 40% of ASEAN’s economic value-add. In addition, the SAT also includes an addendum covering managed coal phase-out, which aims to provide a credible standard to increase participation in projects for the early retirement of coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) that are aligned with a 1.5 degrees Celsius (1.5°C) decarbonisation pathway for the global power sector.\n\n# The key features of the SAT are:\n\n- The activities must contribute to at least one of the five environmental objectives (EOs) which are – (i) climate change mitigation, (ii) climate change adaptation, (iii) protection of healthy ecosystems and biodiversity, (iv) promotion of resource resilience and circular economy, and (v) pollution prevention and control. The SAT currently focuses on defining activities that support the climate change mitigation objective.\n- The SAT is comprehensive in coverage and scopes in activities across eight priority sectors that contribute materially to ASEAN emissions and Gross Value Add. The sectors are – (i) Energy, (ii) Transportation, (ii) Real Estate &#x26; Construction, (iv) Industry, (v) Carbon Capture &#x26; Storage, (vi) Information &#x26; Communications Technology, (vii) Waste &#x26; Water, and (viii) Forestry &#x26; Agriculture.\n- The SAT introduced a world-first traffic light system which outlines guiding principles on how to define green and transition activities. The SAT’s transition thresholds and criteria have been adapted to reflect local or regional contexts by considering local regulations and market standards, technology availability and level of deployment, as well as existing production processes.\n\n\n",

In Southeast Asia, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia have developed their own national taxonomies. At the regional level, criteria for four sectors have been developed under the ASEAN Taxonomy, and the final version of the taxonomy which includes the remaining five sectors will be launched by the end of 2025.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific (APAC), some jurisdictions have introduced or are in the process of introducing transition criteria within their domestic or regional taxonomies. The ASEAN Taxonomy5 has a traffic light system and incorporates a multi-tiered approach comprising a principle-based Foundation Framework (FF) and a criteria-based Plus Standard (PS) which has two tiers under the transition category to account for varying developmental standards across the region. The Hong Kong Taxonomy6, launched in May 2024, currently only includes the green category for four focus sectors but there are plans to expand it to include more sectors and also transition activities. Australia7 has publicly consulted on its taxonomy which will include transition categories and decarbonising measures for six sectors. Outside of APAC, Canada has laid out plans to include a transition category in its taxonomy which defines transition investments in support of a net-zero transition.8\n\nGlobally, recognising the importance of reducing complexity and fragmentation, there are efforts to increase the interoperability of taxonomies’ green activities criteria. These efforts are spearheaded by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF) which comprises 20 members.\n\nIn November 2024, the MAS, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and the European Union Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union (EU DG-FISMA) completed the mapping of the SAT against the PBOC’s Green Bond Endorsed Project Catalogue and the EU Taxonomy, under the Multi-jurisdiction Common Ground Taxonomy (M-CGT).9\n\n# BACKGROUND\n\n1.

This ensures that green activities financed by the government are aligned with the SAT’s defined thresholds. The SAT can also be incorporated into government schemes that promote green business activities, encouraging the adoption of activities aligned with the SAT criteria.                                                                                                       |\n| Banks          | Banks can use the SAT as a reference tool to guide how banks evaluate corporate loans, fund infrastructure projects and structure green, transition and sustainability-linked instruments. Banks can also leverage the SAT during engagements with corporate clients to steer them towards investing in activities that support the decarbonisation outcomes that the clients have identified. Beyond structuring financing solutions, banks can also apply the SAT criteria when issuing their own green or transition bonds or when raising sustainable financing as borrowers. |\n| Asset managers | Asset managers can use taxonomies such as the SAT to ensure that their sustainability-related funds are aligned with credible thresholds and criteria, which in turn informs investment eligibility and portfolio allocation of funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Corporates     | Corporates can evaluate whether planned projects or capital expenditure qualify as green or transition activities as set out under the SAT, and engage financial institutions (FIs) to obtain financing through green, transition or sustainability-linked instruments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n\nBeyond FIs and corporates, other stakeholders are also involved in the structuring of the SAT. The professional services sector plays a crucial role in the successful implementation and credibility of SAT-aligned financing. Professional service providers, such as consultants, external review providers, legal professionals and auditors, help support enhancing the credibility of green and transition financing frameworks and instruments, through the following means:\n\n| **Consultants**                        | Consultants can play a key role through market research, offering strategic advice and advising borrowers and issuers in developing their green or transition finance frameworks that could reference or align with the SAT.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **External review providers**          | External reviewers will provide independent assessments for a borrower or issuer’s framework, bond or loan, by verifying compliance with internationally recognised principles, standards or taxonomies like the SAT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| • Second-Party Opinion (SPO) Providers | SPO providers evaluate and provide an opinion on the alignment of a borrower or issuer’s framework, bond or loan with international and regional standards, such as the International Capital Market Association’s Green Bond Principles (ICMA GBP), ASEAN Green Bond Standards, the Green Loan Principles (GLP) and taxonomies like the SAT.                                                                                          |\n| • Scoring/Rating Providers             | Scoring or rating providers assess and assign a score or rating to a borrower or issuer’s framework, bond or loan against established criteria such as the SAT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| **Legal professionals**                | Legal professionals ensure that all financial instruments referencing the SAT are properly documented and comply with legal requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| **Auditors**                           | Auditors provide pre-issuance assurance of the alignment of a borrower and issuer’s framework with the SAT criteria.

This includes publicly announced developments by the Singapore Government such as the alignment of the Singapore Green Bond Framework (SBGF) with the SAT and the inclusion of SAT-aligned activities under the Enterprise Financing Scheme-Green (EFS-Green).\n\nSection 3 covers efforts that the financial and corporate sectors have taken to align or reference the SAT in their respective sustainable financing frameworks, as well as profile examples of actual market transactions that have referenced the SAT.\n\n# A. Public sector\n\n# (I) Alignment of the Singapore Green Bond Framework (SGBF) with the SAT\n\nThe SGBF is an important component of Singapore’s overarching sustainability strategy and plays a crucial role in advancing Singapore’s national net-zero ambitions. It governs the issuance of sovereign green bonds under the Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act 2021 (SINGA) and serves as a reference for Statutory Boards developing their own green bond frameworks. The inaugural version was published in June 2022.\n\nIn January 2025, the SGBF was updated by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to align green thresholds with those in the SAT, with DNV providing a Second Party Opinion (SPO) confirming the framework’s alignment with the International Capital Market Association’s (ICMA) Bond Principles (GBP), the ASEAN Green Bond Standards, and the SAT. The addition of the SAT thresholds provides more details on the screening criteria for projects to qualify for green bond financing, and demonstrates the Singapore Government’s continued commitment to high-quality public sector green bond issuances.\n\nFollowing the alignment of the SGBF with the SAT, the Statutory Boards of the Singapore Government will also be updating their respective frameworks to align with the SAT. All public sector green bonds issued under the updated SAT-aligned frameworks will be SAT-compliant, in addition to complying with international market standards.\n\n# (II) Expansion of Enterprise Financing Scheme-Green (EFS-Green) to include the SAT’s green and transition activities\n\nThe EFS-Green, launched by EnterpriseSG in October 2021, was expanded on 1 April 2024 to incorporate the SAT activities and extended for two years until 31 March 2026. Previously only applicable to developers of green solutions, the scheme now supports adopters of green or transition solutions and technologies, referencing the SAT’s green and transition criteria under the four qualifying sectors are – (i) Clean Energy &#x26; Decarbonisation, (ii) Circular Economy &#x26; Resource Optimisation, (iii) Green Infrastructure, and (iv) Clean Transportation (Land, Sea, and Air).¹⁰\n\nThe EFS-Green provides 70% risk-sharing to support lending by participating FIs to qualifying Singapore enterprises. This enables companies to access financing for the adoption of credible green technologies, enabling meaningful carbon footprint reduction and contributing to Singapore’s green transition.\n\n# B. Financial sector\n\nFIs such as banks offering financial products (e.g. bonds or loans) to clients can reference the SAT, alongside global green and sustainable finance instrument guidelines and other existing taxonomies, to ensure that the green and transition financial products are credible, hence mitigating the risks of greenwashing.\n\n10 FAQ on Enterprise Financing Scheme – Green.

    "text": "\nSINGAPORE - ASIA TAXONOMY AND ITS APPLICATION FOR THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND CORPORATES\n\nBanks can use the SAT to evaluate the eligibility of projects when structuring financing transactions for their clients and provide strategic steer to their clients on their decarbonisation efforts through client engagements. Asset managers can use taxonomies such as the SAT to ensure that their sustainability-related funds are aligned with credible thresholds and criteria, which in turn informs investment eligibility and portfolio allocation of funds. Refer to Section 4 for examples of the degree of alignment with the SAT for banks’ and asset managers’ lending portfolio and funds retrospectively.\n\nThere are three key ways banks can use the SAT.\n\n# (I) Integration into Sustainable Financing Frameworks\n\nSustainable financing frameworks set out the banks’ approaches to evaluate the eligibility of green and transition projects and govern the origination of financing solutions to ensure they align with the bank’s sustainability objectives or taxonomies. Many of these frameworks are aligned with internationally recognised market principles and taxonomies. The frameworks guide how banks evaluate corporate loans, fund infrastructure projects and structure green, transition and sustainability financial instruments.\n\n# (II) Origination of green and transition financing solutions for their clients\n\nBanks may assist corporates in raising green and transition capital through the following two capital market instruments –\n\n- a. Use-of-proceeds instruments, such as green and transition labelled bonds and loans, where capital raised is exclusively allocated to green and transition projects set out in the loan or bond framework, which may reference the SAT;\n- b. Sustainability-linked instruments, such as sustainability-linked loans and sustainability-linked bonds, where the funds can be used for general corporate purposes, but the loan and bond terms are tied to the issuer or borrower achieving predefined sustainability-related KPIs or targets which may reference the SAT.\n\n# (III) Client engagement on their wider sustainability strategy\n\nBanks can also leverage the SAT during engagements with corporate clients to steer them towards investing in activities that support decarbonisation outcomes that the clients have identified.\n\nThe section below shows how banks have used the SAT in each of the three ways since the launch of the SAT.\n\n# (I) Integration into Sustainable Financing Frameworks\n\nLocal and some foreign banks with a presence in Singapore have made strides in referencing the SAT in their sustainable financing frameworks.\n\nWhilst most banks’ sustainable financing frameworks are designed to support the structuring of green, transition and sustainability-linked financing instruments, some banks have introduced standalone transition frameworks to offer more comprehensive coverage on the hard-to-abate sectors and a more tailored approach when supporting companies that engage in transition activities. Standalone transition frameworks generally provide more granular details on the types of projects accepted, by focusing on sectors that face greater challenges in decarbonisation and addressing the unique needs of hard-to-abate sectors. Banks that have standalone transition finance frameworks are DBS, Maybank, Standard Chartered and UOB.\n\nSingapore’s three local banks (DBS, OCBC, UOB) have either completed or are in the process of updating their sustainable financing frameworks to integrate the SAT, and will be using the SAT as a key reference tool in the structuring of green or transition financing solutions. For example, all\n\n\n",

    "text": "\nSINGAPORE - ASIA TAXONOMY AND ITS APPLICATION FOR THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND CORPORATES\n\nSustainable financing origination and refinancing activities by UOB will adhere to SAT-referenced requirements from 1 July 2025. See Annex for examples of transactions facilitated by local banks that are aligned to the SAT even though they were not formally assessed to be so at the point of issuance.\n\nIn addition, Maybank has updated its sustainable product framework and transition finance framework, while CIMB is in the process of revising theirs. For assets booked in Singapore, Maybank stated that the SAT will serve as a key reference document solely for evaluating transition finance eligibility, while CIMB will use the SAT as a primary technical screening reference for assessing both green and transition finance eligibility. Both banks will also reference the SAT alongside other taxonomies or market standards for global deals.\n\nFor the other foreign banks, the SAT is used as an additional assessment tool alongside other taxonomies or market standards when evaluating green and transition financing solutions. For instance, Crédit Agricole CIB has indicated that the SAT will be used as an additional tool to reflect local context and specificities, alongside the EU Taxonomy, given that the bank’s operations are primarily in the European market. HSBC refers to local and regional taxonomies, including the SAT, as part of their internal governance process and policies. Standard Chartered has adopted the SAT in its Transition Finance Framework as an additional reference point, and the bank is exploring including the SAT into its other sustainable finance frameworks.\n\n# (A) Banks which use the SAT as the primary reference tool for all their sustainable finance transactions\n\n# DBS\n\nDBS’ Sustainable Finance Framework and Taxonomy\n\nIn 2020, DBS launched its sustainable and transition finance framework and taxonomy to help clients advance on their sustainability agenda. DBS has released its updated Sustainable Finance Framework and Taxonomy and its Transition Finance Framework in March 2025.\n\nThe updated Transition Finance Framework11 reflects the latest developments in the transition finance space. The framework is intended to capture opportunities aligned with internationally or nationally recognised and credible taxonomies including the SAT where possible, keeping in mind that guidance from taxonomies and industry best practices do not yet exist for various transition actions and activities. For sectors like energy and real estate, the taxonomy has specific references to the SAT transition category and its TSCs.\n\nThe framework will continue to serve as useful guidance for DBS when interfacing with clients, particularly in supporting corporates with the development of transition plans and projects for transition financing.\n\n# OCBC\n\nOCBC’s Sustainable Finance Taxonomy\n\nOCBC has integrated the SAT into its Sustainable Finance Taxonomy, which is an internal document the bank uses to determine eligibility criteria for green, social or transition activities through use-of-proceeds Sustainable Finance solutions.\n\nOCBC’s Sustainable Finance Taxonomy serves as a key reference for client engagement and financing decisions, enabling OCBC to assess clients’ alignment with the SAT criteria, and offer structured guidance on how companies can position their financing and investments within green and transition categories.\n\n# UOB\n\nUOB’s Sustainable Finance Framework (which includes Transition Finance Framework)\n\nUOB has referenced and incorporated the SAT into all six of UOB’s Sustainable Finance Frameworks12, namely the Sustainable Cities Framework, Circular Economy Framework, Green Building Framework, Sustainable Food &#x26; Agribusiness Framework, Transition Finance Framework and Sustainable Trade Framework. The principles of incorporating the SAT into the UOB frameworks include referencing the SAT technical screening criteria (TSCs) and ensuring value chain inclusion to support SMEs further down the value chain.\n\nAs part of its suite of six sustainable frameworks, UOB has expanded its Transition Finance Framework to cover all qualifying Amber activities in the SAT and adopted a risk-based documentation approach tailored to borrower and ESG risk profiles based on client and sector specialist feedback.\n\nThe frameworks are undergoing external independent validation by Second Party Opinion consultant, ERM, and will be publicly launched in March 2025. Following which, all new and refinanced sustainable financing from 1 July 2025 onwards will adhere to SAT-referenced requirements.\n\n11 DBS Bank Institutional Banking Group (IBG) Transition Finance Framework.

It provides a structured approach in classifying transition finance in line with global standards and science-based taxonomies supporting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C/below 2°C goal. Recognising the differentiated pace of transition required across ASEAN nations, Maybank’s TFF undertakes a principled and pragmatic approach to transition finance transactions. Where national/regional pathways and taxonomies are present and are aligned to the temperature outcome of the Paris Agreement, the bank may choose to reference these taxonomies in determining if an activity can qualify for transition finance. This means that for assets booked in Singapore, the SAT serves as a key reference for evaluating transition finance eligibility. The TFF’s eligible transition activities for Steel Manufacturing, Natural Gas Transmission and Distribution, and International Aviation largely align with SAT’s green or amber categories, with some instances of stricter requirements in place. |                                                                          |\n\n(C) Banks which use the SAT as an additional tool, alongside other taxonomies or standards for sustainable finance transactions\n\n| Crédit Agricole CIB                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Crédit Agricole CIB’s Green Bond Framework                                                                                   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| As foreign banks are required to comply with market regulations in their respective home countries, Crédit Agricole CIB primarily aligns its Green Bond Framework¹⁶ with the EU Taxonomy, given its established role in the European market.

Banks can help structure bonds and loans that reference the SAT.\n\nFor instance, the SAT’s green and transition classifications can define which projects qualify for funding based on the criteria set out. Banks can also align the KPIs or sustainability performance targets (SPTs) of sustainability-linked loans or bonds with specific thresholds from the SAT. Illustrative examples of how the SAT can be applied to the structuring and origination of use-of-proceeds loan and sustainability-linked loans are set out in the box items below.\n\n# How the SAT can be applied to Use-of-Proceeds loans\n\n| COMPONENTS                                  | CRITERIA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Use of Proceeds                             | • Green or Amber as categorised under the SAT can be financed by a Green or Amber Transition loan                                                                                                                                                |\n| Process of Project Evaluation and Selection | • Borrowers to clearly communicate: – How the project satisfies requirements in the SAT – The process of determining how their projects fit within the eligible categories – Any related eligibility criteria                                    |\n| Management of Proceeds                      | • Loan proceeds to be credited in a dedicated account, or otherwise tracked by the borrowers to ensure transparency in their use • Borrowers to establish an internal governance process to track the funds allocation towards eligible projects |\n| Reporting                                   | • Borrowers to keep up-to-date information of the use of proceeds until the loan is fully drawn, and thereafter of any developments • Number and types of green building certification obtained • Rating level of certification                  |\n\nStructure guided by the Loan Market Association’s Green Loan Principles (GLP) and other industry and market best practices.

KPIs, either external or internal, must be material to the borrower’s core sustainability and business strategy.\n\nSustainability Performance Targets (SPTs) are measurable improvements in KPIs. They reflect improvements in the borrower’s sustainability profile. There can be one or more SPTs per KPI. Financing will have a pricing mechanism linked to the achievement of SPTs.\n\nMost sustainability-linked loans will be used for general corporate purposes; there are no restrictions on the deployment of the financing.\n\n# Guidelines &#x26; Pillars\n\nICMA and the Loan Market Associations (APLMA/LMA/LSTA) have published voluntary guidelines with the following pillars:\n\n1. Selection of KPIs\n2. Calibration of Sustainability Performance Targets\n3. Financing Characteristics\n4. Reporting\n5. Verification\n\n# Applicability of the SAT\n\nTaxonomy classifies... Possible applicability to ‘KPI-Linked’ labels through:\n\n| Revenue | CapEx                           | OpEx                                                                                   |\n| ------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1.      | Taxonomy alignment as a KPI     | Green e.g. Proportion of Revenue / CapEx / OpEx aligned to the Taxonomy                |\n| 2.      | Taxonomy as a guidance for KPIs | Amber e.g. Decarbonisation targets aligned to metrics / thresholds set in the Taxonomy |\n\nAmber (Measures)\n\nIneligible\n\n 2\n",

Corporate sector\n\nCorporates can use the SAT to evaluate whether planned projects or capital expenditure qualify as green or transition activities as set out under the SAT, and engage banks to obtain financing through green, transition or sustainability-linked loans and bonds. Corporates may also use the taxonomy to identify emerging opportunities in green and transition sectors.\n\nSeveral corporates have referenced the SAT to structure their sustainable financing, with transactions demonstrating its application in green and transition finance. For example, Green Esteel and OUE S Limited have taken the step to develop their financing frameworks in alignment with the SAT. OUE E C Limited has also issued an inaugural green bond aligned with the SAT, where the bond’s use-of-proceeds allocated is in accordance with the SAT.\n\n# Corporate Sustainable Finance frameworks\n\n# Green Esteel’s Green and Transition Framework\n\nOCBC partnered Green Esteel to develop the steel sector’s first Green and Transition Finance Framework, referencing the SAT’s technical screening criteria. The Framework includes six Eligible Green and Transition Business Activities, spanning across crucial technologies for the sector’s transition, such as: Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), Electric Arc Furnace (EAF), Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS), manufacture and storage of hydrogen, renewable energy etc. which are crucial activities for decarbonising the steel industry. This initiative illustrates how the SAT can guide sectors with high emissions intensities toward a low-carbon future.\n\n \n\n",

Going forward, financial institutions can push towards more financing solutions which are in alignment with the SAT to further their commitment in sustainable financing.\n\n# (I) Local banks’ portfolio alignment\n\nWhile past transactions before the publication of the SAT had not considered the SAT definitions at the point of financing, a sizeable proportion of Singapore’s three local banks’ portfolios already adhere to the SAT thresholds. The majority of OCBC’s green financing portfolio meets the SAT thresholds. For DBS, more than half of its sustainable and green loan assets are broadly aligned with the SAT green criteria. Similarly, UOB has estimated that 35% to 45% of its sustainable financing portfolio are aligned with the SAT, covering sectors such as real estate, data centres, solar, and agri-commodities.\n\nA list of examples of past corporate transactions from DBS, OCBC, and UOB that are assessed to be in-principle aligned with the SAT on a retrospective basis is in the Annex.\n\n# (II) Asset managers’ funds alignment\n\nAsset managers can also use taxonomies such as the SAT to align their sustainability-related funds with credible thresholds and criteria, guiding investment eligibility and portfolio allocation. Amundi is one such example.\n\n# Amundi\n\nAs a responsible asset manager, Amundi has developed a transition investment framework based on its proprietary scoring methodology, the Paris Aligned Score (PAS), to evaluate the credibility of companies’ transition paths. This framework accounts for regional differences in transition pathways, utilising local taxonomies, such as the SAT, as complementary references where data is available.\n\nTo assess the practicality of the transition investment framework, Amundi has created a cross-asset investment strategy that includes both equity and fixed income assets, focusing on identifying companies in Asian emerging markets based on the progress of their transition paths.\n\nAmundi recognises three main challenges in transition investing: insufficient investment flows in hard-to-abate sectors, a lack of climate data and standardised disclosures in emerging markets, and inadequate benchmarks for decarbonisation. To address these challenges, Amundi employs the PAS to evaluate companies’ transition efforts and alignment with net-zero goals. The investment strategy prioritises financing companies with credible transition plans, particularly in high-emitting sectors (e.g. aluminium, cement, steel, and metals &#x26; mining), as well as low-emitting sectors with significant\n\n\n",

Financial products have been developed based on the thresholds and criteria of the SAT, sustainable finance frameworks across banks and corporates have been aligned with or make reference to the SAT criteria, and corporates’ decarbonisation plans have been guided by the SAT.\n\nAs adoption grows, collaboration between FIs and the broader ecosystem will be crucial to enhance the taxonomy’s effectiveness. The Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA) is driving several industry-led initiatives to support the adoption and application of the SAT, including the publication of a SAT Transition Financing Handbook to guide the application of transition thresholds and a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) to address practical queries from taxonomy users. These efforts will help to promote a deeper understanding of taxonomy activities while enhancing transparency and consistency of green and transition finance, and further increase the use of the SAT.\n\nWe encourage industry stakeholders to harness the benefits of the SAT by adopting and actively implementing the SAT, in order to collectively drive meaningful progress towards a sustainable future.\n\n\n",

The framework, which received an SPO from S&#x26;P Global Ratings to be aligned with the GLP, guides loan proceeds to finance eligible renewable energy projects, including solar and wind power generation, reinforcing Hero Asia’s commitment to clean energy.\n\nSubsequently, OCBC extended an inaugural US$100 million green loan under the Green Loan Framework to finance renewable energy projects that meet the framework’s criteria. This is aligned with the green criteria under the Energy sector in the SAT for wind energy.\n\n# Rexus Bioenergy’s Green Loan for Biomass Power Plant\n\nDBS supported Rexus Bioenergy with a green loan for Singapore’s first circular biomass power plant with integrated carbon capture technologies. The green electricity generated from the facility will partially supply power to Google’s data center operations in Singapore. Rexus has secured a 10-year virtual Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with PacificLight Energy and Google, ensuring long-term economic viability. The facility will also be certified under the International Renewable Energy Certificate (I-REC), ensuring compliance with international green energy standards.\n\nThis aligns with the green criteria under SAT’s Energy sector for bioenergy power.\n\n# Singtel’s Green Loan for Green Mark-certified Data Centres\n\nDBS, OCBC, Standard Chartered and UOB are supporting Singtel with a S$535 million Green Loan for BCA Green Mark-certified data centres. The loan proceeds will refinance existing borrowings and support the operations of DC West and DC Kim Chuan, both of which have attained the highest Green Mark Platinum certification. Singtel, one of Singapore’s largest and most advanced data centre operators, also recently broke ground on DC Tuas, a 58MW hyper-connected green data centre that will further strengthen Singapore’s digital infrastructure.\n\nThis is aligned with the green criteria under the Real Estate &#x26; Construction sector in SAT.\n\n# Terrenus Energy’s Green Loan for Renewable Energy Solutions\n\nDBS is leading the advising and financing of about S$300 million in green loan to Terrenus Energy, a leading provider of renewable energy solutions, which has successfully secured about S$300 million in green financing from a consortium of five banks led by DBS. The green loan will finance the installation of photovoltaic panels on some 1,200 public housing blocks and 57 government sites, as well as commercial and industrial facilities. It also includes a ground-mounted-cum-floating solar project for capacity of 24.5MW in Singapore, as well as the JTC Solar Roof Phase 3 project.\n\nAligned with the green criteria in SAT’s Energy sector for solar energy, this represents one of the largest renewable energy deployments in Singapore to date and will accelerate Singapore’s green ambitions.\n\n# Yinson GreenTech’s Green Loan for Electric Vessel\n\nOCBC provided financing for Yinson GreenTech for the region’s first fully electric hydrofoil crew transfer vessel, the Hydroglyder, a sustainable alternative to fossil-fuel-powered boats. The Hydroglyder’s hydrofoil system lifts the hull above the water, significantly reducing drag and energy consumption. This innovative design results in up to 80% lower energy consumption and significantly lower operational costs compared to conventional vessels.\n\nAligned with the green criteria under the Transportation sector in the SAT — vessels with zero direct tailpipe CO2 emissions, the Hydrogylder’s zero emission technology and energy-efficient design represent a key step towards advancing the maritime industry’s decarbonisation efforts.\n\n",
