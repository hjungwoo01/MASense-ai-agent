# Introduction

Climate change is already having widespread effects on nature and people around the world. There is clear scientific evidence that climate change poses one of the greatest existential threats to humanity and the planet. It is a problem which demands action now. While climate change is a global threat, Asia, home to majority of the world’s population, is warming faster than the global average according to the World Meteorological Organization.1

Singapore, as an international financial centre, is well-placed to support the sustainable economy agenda and catalyse sustainable and transition financing needs for the region and globally. To advance on the development, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has convened an industry-led initiative called the Green Finance Industry Taskforce (GFIT) to focus on a few key initiatives, including the development of a Taxonomy.

This is the final version of the first Singapore-Asia Taxonomy (Taxonomy) issued by GFIT2, convened by MAS and with technical support and recommendations from the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI). GFIT comprises of representatives from financial institutions, corporates, non-governmental organisations, and financial industry associations. All relevant Singapore Government agencies, as well as the public via rounds of consultations, have provided input and feedback into the process. GFIT, MAS, CBI, and the agencies have taken a consensus-based approach to develop the Taxonomy. Regular GFIT meetings and communications were held to discuss and review material points about the Taxonomy. In situations where divergence of views were present, GFIT would consider the recommendations from key parties, revise the criteria and the Taxonomy where required with a pragmatic stance, and explain the rationale in the Taxonomy.

The Taxonomy is designed to promote the development of an environmentally sustainable economy for Singapore and ASEAN through defining science-based and robust technical screening criteria for economic activities and projects that are aligned with Singapore and region’s overall environmental objectives. In line with the vision of Singapore’s 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for carbon emissions, as well as achieving the targets under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the Taxonomy aims to define the green and transition economy and opportunities. In addition, it serves as a practical guidance for market participants such as asset owners, investment managers, financial institutions, as well as issuers, policymakers, regulators, and other stakeholders to identify and allocate capital to green and transition activities and projects.

# The Taxonomy’s main aims, principles and practices are as follows:

# Aims

# Principles

# Practices

Provide clarity and consistency for financiers, companies and government agencies. The measures of success therefore relate to these stakeholders. In particular, the following could be considered as useful measures of success:

The criteria have been developed by environmental and industry experts and reference the latest Singaporean, ASEAN, EU and international thinking. This allows investors to have clarity, consistency and harmonised reporting for their investments in both Singapore and the global markets.

Investors marketing environmentally sustainable funds can invest in Taxonomy-eligible activities, engage companies on how they are progressing towards Taxonomy thresholds, or provide their own explanation for how they will achieve the fund’s goals. The Taxonomy also allows a better understanding of the environmental risks facing Singaporean companies under a low-carbon transition pathway. Investing in Taxonomy-eligible activities is not mandatory.

The Taxonomy includes a list of economic activities and projects that are classified as Green (environmentally sustainable), Amber (transition) or Ineligible on the basis of their contribution to at least one of the Taxonomy’s five environmental objectives, whilst at the same time not causing any significant harm to the other four.

# These five main environmental objectives are aligned with the EU Taxonomy, although at present this Taxonomy has only determined economic activities and technical screening criteria for climate change mitigation. The other four environmental objectives will be added in future iterations:

- Climate change mitigation
- Climate change adaptation
- Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity
- Promote resource resilience and circular economy
- Pollution prevention and control

The Taxonomy should allow allocators and providers of capital to align their investments in and lending to different companies, assets and strategies with activities that are classified as green (environmentally sustainable), amber (transition) or ineligible within a flexible classification framework. It is not designed to be an exhaustive or mandatory list of activities or projects for investment, nor does it seek to make any judgments or assessments of the benefits or financial performance of any of the activities and their classification.

The Taxonomy bridges the gap between international goals and financing practices, clearly signalling the types of activities that are consistent with the low-carbon transition, adaptation to climate change and other environmental objectives.

Assessing the success of the Taxonomy:

There are a number of key stakeholders that need to embrace the Taxonomy in order for it to be considered a success.

1. The extent to which the Taxonomy is compatible / consistent with other taxonomies. Given capital is global, as are capital market participants, it is important that the Taxonomy is compatible / consistent with other taxonomies. This does not mean that it is identical, more that the Taxonomy should make use of a consistent approach and language and be inter-operable with other taxonomies. There should not be elements that are incompatible. Efforts at tracking such developments are being conducted by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance.

2. The extent to which new products are developed that (or existing products are modified to) align with the Taxonomy. Given the Taxonomy sets the foundations for directing capital to activities that are demonstrably ‘green’, one measure of success is the extent to which capital market participants either develop (or modify existing) products to align with or map to the Taxonomy. The number of products that align with or map to the Taxonomy can be easily tracked.

3. The extent to which regulators reference the Taxonomy when approving products or services. Given consumers of products and services have voiced concerns over ‘greenwashing’ of products, the ability of regulators to refer to a universal reference point (i.e. the Taxonomy) in approving a product as green or otherwise would provide comfort to users.

4. The extent to which other frameworks / standards reference the Taxonomy. Linking with the point below on the compatibility / consistency with other taxonomies, if this outcome can be achieved then one measure of success is the extent to which other frameworks / standards (as they relate to ‘green’ bonds etc.) reference the Taxonomy.

5. The extent to which the Taxonomy is embedded within frontline regulatory disclosure requirements. Given this paper identifies a lack of applicable data as a significant hurdle, one measure of success is the way frontline regulators (stock exchanges, for example) embrace the Taxonomy.

# Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation

Example) require corporate disclosure that directly maps to the requirements of the Taxonomy. This should include, where possible, information on the “Do No Significant Harm” clause of the Taxonomy.

Disclosure requirements can be easily tracked. Globally, while taxonomies focus on slightly different objectives based on their jurisdictional context, they are broadly consistent with the six environmental objectives in the EU Taxonomy. In the EU Taxonomy and others, environmental objectives are interlinked – i.e. an activity is included in the Taxonomy if it contributes substantially to one of the objectives while not significantly harming any other objectives.

Every effort should be taken so as to ensure that tools and support are available for all issuers, including and in particular small and mid-sized enterprises. This is an issue which can and should be monitored at regular intervals.

The extent to which the disclosure requirements present an ‘undue burden’ on corporates cannot be avoided. However, one success of the Taxonomy would be the extent to which this effort represents an undue burden.

As the ASEAN region undergoes rapid urbanisation and economic development, it is currently expected to depend on fossil fuels at least in the medium term. The region’s rising fossil fuel demand will increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and exacerbate local air pollution. Hence, economic activities that enable the transition from fossil fuels to increase their carbon efficiency and/or to more sustainable energy sources are essential to mitigate climate change.

For instance, in Singapore, even with the scale up in solar energy solutions, Singapore will still have a heavy reliance on natural gas in the coming decades due to its limited access to other renewable energy sources. Therefore, it is also important to direct financial resources to activities aimed at making natural gas plants more carbon efficient to support the country’s carbon abatement goals.

Mitigating climate change requires reducing the release of GHG emissions in the atmosphere, with the key objective of enacting measures to limit the extent of climate change. An activity can be considered to have met this objective if it makes substantial contribution to:

1. Avoid GHG emissions: These are ‘green activities’, which are already having very low or near-zero emissions. More capital is required to increase their development and wider deployment.
2. Reduce GHG emissions: These are transition activities that are currently high carbon and critical to the functioning of the economy but are in transition to less carbon-intensive business models. This Taxonomy includes transition activities involving fossil fuels, albeit limited to abated natural gas and managed coal phase-out under certain circumstances.

Singapore aims to increase solar energy deployment by five-fold to at least 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030. However, due to limitations such as its small physical size and land scarcity, Singapore faces challenges in relying on renewable sources to generate sufficient baseload electricity. Therefore, mitigation efforts have also focused on transitioning to natural gas, a comparatively less carbon-intensive fuel, as well as enhancing energy efficiency across the key sectors of power generation, industry, transport, buildings, and households.

For example, Singapore has set the target of reducing peak land transport emissions by 80% by 2050 from the 2016 peak, with vehicle electrification as the main driver.

# Objective 2: Climate Change Adaptation

Climate change adaptation refers to activities that substantially reduce the adverse impact of the current and expected future climate on either (i) other people, nature or assets or (ii) the economic activity itself, in each case without increasing the risk of an adverse impact on other people, nature and assets.

# Environmental Objectives

The key purpose of developing the Taxonomy for Singapore-based Financial Institutions (FIs) is to encourage the flow of capital to support the low-carbon transition needed to avoid catastrophic climate change. The Taxonomy intends to cover both green and transition activities with the following five environmental objectives:

1. Climate change mitigation
2. Climate change adaptation
3. Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity
4. Promote resource resilience and circular economy
5. Pollution prevention and control

The transition to a circular economy; Pollution prevention and control; The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.

It is recognised that there is also considerable discussion around the issue of methane leakage and natural gas, with scientific evidence growing over time. This is an issue that requires consideration and monitoring.

Adaptation measures respond to physical risks that in some cases irreversible ecosystem losses. At the same time, the sustainable management of ecosystems and efforts to restore biodiversity is critical to climate change mitigation. For example, conserved or restored habitats such as forests and wetlands are natural carbon sinks and have the added benefit of preventing climatic hazards such as rising sea levels, floods and droughts.

An economic activity can be considered to meet the objective of climate change adaptation by meeting one, or both, of the following principles:

- Principle 1: The economic activity implements measures to increase own resilience. E.g. raising building heights above projected sea level rises, installing more efficient cooling facilities in anticipation of an increase in the number of warmer days.
- Principle 2: The economic activity enables other economic activities to adapt to climate change. E.g. providers of cooling systems for buildings, sensors for flood monitoring.

Additionally, the economic activity should not adversely affect adaptation efforts by others, or increase the physical risks posed to others. E.g. water storage solutions should not deprive others in the communities from accessing water during dry weather.

By the year 2100, it is projected that Singapore could experience an increase in daily mean temperature by 1.4°C to 4.6°C, more frequent and intense heavy rainfall events, and mean sea level rise of up to 1 meter. Singapore has adopted a Resilience Framework that frames its overall approach to climate change adaptation, which involves assessment of risks, formulation of adaptation pathways, prioritisation and implementation of measures. Additionally, under the Resilient Future vision of the Singapore Green Plan, initiatives have been introduced to:

- (i) complete the formulation of coastal protection plans for certain areas by 2030, and
- (ii) moderate the rise in urban heat.

Objective 3: Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity (not covered in this version)

Climate change and biodiversity are interconnected. Climate change has compounded biodiversity losses globally, with around a million plant and animal species threatened with extinction within decades. The IPCC has warned that failure to limit global warming to 1.5°C will have long-lasting and severe consequences.

Examples of ecosystem-based adaptation activities include:

1. Coastal defense through the maintenance and/or restoration of mangroves and other coastal wetlands against flooding and protection of natural carbon sinks.
2. Promote protection, restoration and sustainable use of coastal and marine environment, which provide essential ecological, economic and social services in the ASEAN region.
3. Enhancing sustainable forest management including afforestation, reforestation and maintenance of forest ecosystem health and vitality to increase carbon storage capacity in forest ecosystems.
4. Establishment of diverse agroforestry systems to cope with increased risk from changed climatic conditions.
5. Conservation of agrobiodiversity to provide specific gene pools for crop and livestock adaptation to climate change.

As also highlighted earlier, an explicit goal of the City in Nature vision under the Singapore Green Plan is to implement species recovery plans for 100 species of plants and 60 species of animals, restore 30 hectares of forest, marine, and coastal habitats, and enhance habitats in at least 50% of Singapore’s gardens, parks, and streetscapes.

As an international finance hub, Singapore is well placed to accelerate sustainable financing to address ecosystems and biodiversity threats. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that the global investment in nature-based solutions will need to triple in real terms by 2030 and increase four-fold by 2050 if the world is to meet its climate change, biodiversity and land degradation targets as set out in the three Rio Conventions. The 2050 requirement represents cumulative total investment of up to USD 8.1 trillion. On annual terms, this equates to USD 536 billion each year, up from the current USD 133 billion.¹⁰

# Objective 5: Pollution prevention and control

(not covered in this version)

Pollution prevention and control involves practices that prevent, reduce and/or eliminate pollution of air, water or land, and in doing so, mitigate risks or harmful effects to the environment, and to human health. This is important as pollution is a key driver of (i) biodiversity loss and (ii) human diseases. Biodiversity loss as explained earlier is expected to exacerbate global warming through the reduction of natural carbon sinks. Climate change and pollution are thus interconnected; for example, preventing air pollution could contribute to climate change mitigation, while reducing emissions could in turn improve air quality. Pollution is also a significant environmental cause of human diseases which we need to seek to ameliorate. According to the WHO, exposure to air pollution is estimated to cause 7 million premature deaths every year.¹²

# Examples of activities that could contribute significantly to resource efficiency and resilience include:

1. Management of wastes from chemicals, plastics, packaging, electronics, textiles, construction materials, food as well as from oil &#x26; gas mining.
2. Promote water pollution control measures and cross-border cooperation prioritising water-related development activities.
3. Eco-friendly consumer packaging.
4. Sustainable food and agriculture technologies to increase shelf life, reduce wastage from farm to table.

# Guiding principles for the development of the Taxonomy

The aim of a taxonomy is to provide a common framework for the classification of economic activities to enable stakeholders in gathering information related to green financing, funding, and investment, as well as gain an understanding of risk management and promote investments that meet robust sustainability goals. A taxonomy should allow stakeholders to determine which financial products and services can be classified as green, or environmentally sustainable, over the long term. Furthermore, it should enable transparent and consistent disclosures by corporates of their own economic activities and environmental profile, which then permits transparent and

## Page 11


# 1. Introduction

consistent classifications and disclosures for Singapore-focused there are similarities, especially with respect to climate change mitigation by operating at near zero emissions, or are on a 1.5°C-aligned pathway.

associated equity and debt investment, financing, and financial products. In doing so, a Taxonomy would enable growth in sustainable products and services by removing ambiguity and uncertainty around classifications and labels, which in turn may stimulate demand for further environmentally sustainable financing and investment. A taxonomy would also facilitate reporting and classification of portfolios by Financial Institutions, which in turn may further stimulate demand for financial products and services.

On top of this, a taxonomy could also help Financial Institutions engage with issuers through a common language; the Taxonomy would allow Financial Institutions and issuers to discuss with reference to a benchmark classification system, based in and informed by science, the contribution of their activities to sustainable development.

Finally, a taxonomy could be helpful for macro-prudential regulators that wish to understand potential risks to financial stability that stem from “unsustainable” activities.

# 2. Science-based

The overall objective of the Taxonomy is to help identify investment consistent with achieving the necessary yet ambitious climate actions. The Taxonomy aims to draw a direct bridge between climate science and usable guidance for the financial sector. The criteria for the Taxonomy are hence based on science as far as possible, and on solid data, with references to data sources provided. In specific cases where a reference to scientific data cannot be provided, this is clearly signaled.

The technical screening tables indicate which sources have been used as the basis for the science which include the EU Taxonomy, Science-based Targets Initiative, Transition Pathway Initiative, Climate Bonds Initiative as well as academic sources. The selection of science basis was based on what was readily available and usable in the context. As a priority, EU Taxonomy was considered as the first priority. Other sources were chosen in discussion with GFIT, relevant agencies within Singapore and based on available and usable data.

# 3. Economic activity structure

To identify the economic activities to be covered by this Taxonomy, GFIT defined activities on the basis of ISIC codes (level 3 for activity) given the wide coverage and usage of ISIC. Moreover, this would enable interoperability with other taxonomies such as the Common Ground Taxonomy developed by the International Platform for Sustainable Finance which similarly uses ISIC codes. For this version of the Taxonomy which proposes activity-level criteria and thresholds for three of the eight focus sectors (energy, transport, and buildings), GFIT decided to use a selection of ISIC codes within each of these three sectors. This selection was based on the importance to the Singapore and regional economy, the impact of each activity on GHG emissions (and emission reduction) as well as the ASEAN Taxonomy activity selection (which was also based on similar selection criteria pertaining to the region).

# 3.1 Green activities

The principle for building the traffic light system is to consider the science-based 1.5°C pathway and the EU Taxonomy criteria for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation as a first option for “green” criteria. In certain cases, the metric and thresholds have then been adapted to reflect Singapore and regional specific circumstances.

# 3.2 Amber activities

The Amber category in the Taxonomy includes activities that are not presently on 1.5°C pathway, but are either:

- Moving towards alignment with the Paris Agreement

# 3.3 Ineligible

Performance or activity incompatible with 1.5°C or not possible to assess.

| Emissions              | Amber transition                                           | Green transition     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Globally interoperable | Aligned with the Paris Agreement pathway but not near zero | Near Zero activities |

Figure 1: Net-zero pathway for Green, Amber, Ineligible

## Page 12

SINGAPORE - ASIA TAXONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE FINANCE | 2023

# Moving towards a Green transition pathway

For some activities, there are no Amber criteria. This means that the technological options to operate in line with a 1ᵒC pathway are sufficiently developed. Hence, the activity can reasonably meet criteria and thresholds to be considered green in line with the Taxonomy.

The amber category is, unless otherwise stated, relevant only for transitioning of existing infrastructure and activities and it does not apply to new projects. This is in recognition of the fact that the amber category is, by definition, not aligned with a 1.5°C trajectory and building of new activities with long lifespans beyond the sunset dates, would lock in assets longer into the future, resulting in stranded assets.

# Amber (measures)

In some sectors of the Taxonomy, Amber (measures) have been proposed to provide additional options for users.

At the date of publication of this Taxonomy, there was no detail available as to how the Taxonomy would be applied and used. This means that it may be used for classifying CapEx or assets investments through, for example, debt instruments such as green bonds/loans (e.g. China Taxonomy) or disclosure of green revenues (e.g. EU Taxonomy) or both.

Given this uncertainty as well as the fact that the amber category provides an additional layer of complexity and flexibility to the Taxonomy, amber measures are specified separately to amber activities to provide options at a point in time that are greening the activity even though it may not meet the criteria.

# Transition Requirements

A transition cannot last indefinitely – at some point in time, the amber activity should be following a 1.5°C pathway to net zero otherwise there is no real impact. Transition requires change over time and therefore to demonstrate the transition, there is a need to show how change is happening over time but this is difficult to capture in a binary taxonomy threshold that are static at a point in time.

To address both issues, Amber criteria have a defined sunset date. At the sunset date, there is no longer an amber category and either the activity is aligned with the 1.5°C pathway (Green category) or it is downgraded to “Ineligible activities” category. As above, this does not mean that the activity has to be zero emissions by the sunset date but rather aligned with the 1.5°C pathway. The intention is that this ensures that transition is not forever and it facilitates change over time by ensuring taxonomy users move towards aligning with Green criteria or risk being ineligible.

# Ineligible Activities

Ineligible activities under the Taxonomy may not always indicate significant harm. The Ineligible activities category concerns activities that are not currently eligible under the Taxonomy. The intention of this Taxonomy and the technical work was not to produce a definitive guide to what significant harm (to climate mitigation) or directly unsustainable activities mean across sectors.

This classification therefore indicates performance thresholds for activities that are not eligible for financing in this Taxonomy. In some cases, this can be implied as harmful and in others, it is less clear. The result remains the same (ineligible) but the perception is different.

# Figure 2: Illustrative 2050 pathways aligned with a range of temperatures

| Time                                                                                           | 2050 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Transition pathways that are aligned with a net-zero 2050 end point that are aligned with 4ᵒC. |      |

Another addition that was made which is different to other taxonomies is to introduce amber measures – these help to demonstrate change over time and are discussed in more detail below.

14New activities are defined as activities that have reached financial investment decision (i.e., date by which investor commitments to invest in activities must be finalised) before 31 Dec 2023. Retrofits to existing infrastructure are not considered new activities but can instead follow criteria for existing activities.

## Page 13


# Further, there are some activities or components

The sunset dates for the transition period are generally set at 2030. However, for activities that are very hard to abate, a longer period was given. These activities are not assessed against the traffic light system at this point in time and are not in scope (i.e., they are neither Green, Amber, nor Ineligible).

GFIT does not anticipate that these sunset dates will be altered unless there is a strong case to do so e.g. they are not aligned with up-to-date transition trends in various industries.

- mandatory/voluntary nature of the Taxonomy
- use of Taxonomy in disclosure guidance/regulation
- use of Taxonomy in debt financing such as Green bond/loan
- expectations on frequency of reporting and compliance

Where possible, thresholds and criteria have been provided for future time periods to provide visibility over how thresholds will change over time following a science-based pathway to net zero. Inclusion of pathways offers the investors and industry planning advantage and greater predictability of potential future conditions, a quality sought from taxonomies that in most cases focused on providing thresholds only for a given point in time.

# Do No Significant Harm

This final version of the first Singapore-Asia taxonomy is issued by the Green Finance Industry Taskforce (GFIT), convened by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, with technical support and recommendations from the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI). GFIT comprises of representatives from financial institutions, corporates, non-governmental organisations, and financial industry associations. All relevant rounds of consultations have also provided input and feedback into the process.

GFIT notes that these pathways are indicative and may be subject to revisions based on scientific evidence, new available technologies etc. GFIT notes that particularly for criteria far into the future (beyond 2035), there is some uncertainty as to which technologies will be available and the extent to which they are low-carbon. These thresholds should be seen as indicative and may be revised in future iterations.

# Application of the Taxonomy

The application of the Taxonomy to financial markets, debt instruments such as Green bond/loan, corporate disclosure regulations as well as its voluntary or mandatory status have not yet been decided or put forward for public consultation and are, therefore, at this stage beyond the scope of the Taxonomy.

# Sunset dates

The Amber criteria have a sunset date to ensure that transition does not last forever and that the thresholds facilitate movement towards green.

| Ineligible                                                 | sunset date          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Emissions                                                  | Amber transition     |
| Moving towards alignment with the Paris Agreement          | Green transition     |
| Aligned with the Paris Agreement pathway but not near zero | Near Zero activities |

# Context

Globally, decarbonisation of electricity generation is critical to meeting the Paris Agreement and to enabling the decarbonisation of other sectors. Further, the low-carbon alternatives are both economically and technologically viable in most jurisdictions, meaning that the decarbonisation of electricity generation will be required to be quicker than hard-to-abate sectors where the low-carbon pathways are less clear.

The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) pathway for electricity generation shows a 1.5ᵒC pathway decarbonising by 2040.

# Singapore

Singapore has committed to meet a net zero target by 2050 and has enhanced its NDC to reduce emissions to around 60MtCO2e in 2030 after peaking emissions earlier. Power generation accounts for ~40% of Singapore’s total carbon emissions today¹⁷ and decarbonisation of the sector is critical to meet climate pledges.

The big challenge that Singapore faces in electricity generation is its geography. As a small and highly urbanised city-state with low wind speeds and relatively flat land, the ability to access renewable or alternative clean energy at scale is limited.

To decarbonise electricity generation, Singapore will continue to enhance the efficiency and reliability of electricity generation from natural gas, while developing and ramping up supply of alternative low-carbon energy sources including¹⁸:

- (i) Solar deployment
- (ii) Regional power grids to bring in low-carbon electricity by 2035, and
- (iii) Low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen, geothermal and other technologies such as carbon capture and storage.

Singapore is taking steps to maximise the available spaces for solar deployment, by tapping on locations such as rooftops, buildings, reservoirs, offshore sea space/islets etc. However, based on a study by the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore, Singapore only has a solar potential of approximately 8GWp¹⁹ technical potential. Singapore aims to achieve the solar target of at least 2GWp by 2030 (which will constitute around 3% of the country’s total protected electricity demand in 2030). To complement solar deployment efforts, Singapore has also announced

## Page 16


plans to import up to 4GW of low-carbon electricity by 2035 (which is expected to make up around 30% of the total projected supply in 2035), and is actively studying other low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen, geothermal and CCUS to further decarbonise the sector in the longer term.

There remain some concerns around hydrogen leakage which will need to be assessed as more evidence becomes available. Hydrogen is an indirect GHG and while there is not yet scientific consensus on its global warming potential, leakages are likely to be problematic and will need to be monitored and mitigated. There is limited data and research on this at this point in time, but this will need to be reviewed and further criteria added as it becomes available.

# TSC overview and methodology

This section provides an overview of the criteria and the methodology undertaken to develop them for the sector as a whole. Detailed activity-specific criteria are at the end of the chapter.

Existing infrastructure may be retrofitted in line with the Amber measures criteria defined below to qualify for transition finance. These are designed to facilitate reductions in emissions using 2 levers that, at the time of writing, understood to be feasible for the Singapore context:

- Blending of low-carbon gas e.g. hydrogen (as per above)
- Carbon capture and storage

Both of these levers are technologically feasible but face some hurdles to reach scale and viability. Following 2030, the assumption is that these key technologies are available and have been implemented.

The GFIT notes that this approach is not universally recommended in most jurisdictions where fossil fuel electricity generation will need to be phased out entirely to meet climate targets.

For new projects, this means that the green threshold is at 100gCO2e/kWh to bring the grid average down rapidly. This threshold drops to 50gCO2e/kWh to 2050. This figure is indicative at this point and will likely revise to 0g but is maintained at 50g based on current average emissions associated with renewable energy.

# Choice of metrics

To be consistent with other global taxonomies including the EU Taxonomy, the primary metric for measuring emissions for electricity generation is gCO₂e/kWh. The Green thresholds are based on lifecycle assessment (LCA) in line with EU Taxonomy.

Ultimately, lifecycle emissions are essential to account for GHG emissions throughout the value chain of electricity production processes (e.g., electricity generation from natural gas can have significantly large emissions due to methane leakage during extraction, transportation, and distribution in addition to combustion).

National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) data on the following page shows the huge range of emissions.

# Table 2.1 — Criteria for Amber measures: use of proceeds eligible investments

Figure 5: Lifecycle emissions range for types of electricity generation²¹ 2022–2035*

Green measures Not applicable

Amber measures Meet one of the following criteria:

- Retrofit of existing power plants to allow hydrogen or its derivatives (e.g. ammonia) that meet the CCGT technological readiness thresholds and criteria in Table 2.2, or
- New power plants (e.g. CCGTs or fuel cells) that can allow hydrogen or its derivatives (e.g. ammonia) that meet the CCGT technological readiness thresholds and criteria in Table 2.2, or
- Retrofit of existing plants with CCS that is designed at the outset to allow the facility to meet the green criteria by 2035 at the latest, or
- New power plants that capture at least 50% of emissions and are designed to meet green activity criteria by a 2035 at the latest, or
- Retrofit of existing transmission and distribution networks that allow ≥50vol% low-carbon gases, or
- New transmission and distribution networks that allow ≥50vol% low-carbon gases, or
- Retrofit of existing storage systems that allow ≥50vol% low-carbon gases, or
- New storage systems that allow ≥50vol% low-carbon gases; or
- Other investments directly supporting or facilitating hydrogen uptake in the plant are eligible if the measures result in the new plant to allow ≥50vol% hydrogen or its derivatives, (e.g. purchase, operation, and maintenance measures).

And, all measures must meet the following criteria:

- The power cannot be generated from renewable energy sources, based on a comparative assessment with the most cost-effective and technically feasible renewable alternative for the same capacity identified; the result of this comparative assessment is published and is subject to a stakeholder consultation.

Amber measures can be new and qualifying measures do not need to meet the amber activity thresholds in Table 1.

Upper thresholds should be used to ensure that fugitive emissions are not high enough to mean that there is no climate value to the importation of electricity as a decarbonisation lever.

*Criteria have an initial sunset date of 2035 after which point they will not be applicable. The criteria and sunset dates are not fixed and will be reviewed and possibly revised periodically based on emerging science and technology.

Note: Renewable and low-carbon gases include non-fossil gaseous fuels, such as biomethane and biogas, as well as hydrogen and its derivatives.

| CCGT technological readiness for hydrogen or its derivatives | New plants need to meet the thresholds set out in the amber measures table. For e.g., CCGTs that secures financing from 2029 need to be 50% hydrogen-ready at the onset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |           |           |           |                                                               |

Singapore’s ability to tap on low-carbon hydrogen to decarbonise will depend on the availability and security of low-carbon hydrogen supply chain in the future given that we are alternative energy disadvantaged and would not have excess renewable energy to produce low-carbon hydrogen domestically. Furthermore, as 100% hydrogen-ready CCGTs (utility scale) are still being developed and it is uncertain whether such CCGTs can also run on natural gas for baseload generation to meet Singapore’s energy demand before hydrogen supply is available and as a backup fuel option in case of hydrogen supply disruption. Hence it may not be feasible for companies to deploy 100% hydrogen-ready CCGTs before hydrogen supply is ready in Singapore. |           |           |           |                                                               |
|                                                              | For 2033-2035, the deployment of new 50-100% hydrogen-ready CCGT would be provided as a forward guidance by EMA, based on when we expect utility-scale units to be available with acceptable reliability, efficiency, and baseload compatibility with natural gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |           |           |           |                                                               |
|                                                              | For CCGTs that had secured financing before the thresholds were ratcheted up in 2029 and 2033, the plants will have to demonstrate that they have an entity level target to retrofit and be 100% ready no later by 2035 if not earlier. The 2035 timeline to complete retrofitting is not applicable to countries like Singapore which are alternative energy disadvantaged. Singapore recognises the importance for companies to commit to retrofit the CCGT to be 100% hydrogen-ready to meet Singapore’s net-zero commitment. Given the constraints mentioned above, the timeline to retrofit to 100% hydrogen-ready for Singapore CCGTs will be based on EMA’s forward guidance, e.g. through Singapore’s Emission Standards, when EMA requires CCGTs to be retrofitted to 100% hydrogen-ready with baseload compatibility with natural gas.                                                                                            |           |           |           |                                                               |

| Amber                  | All operation of storage systems for hydrogen which cradle to gate emissions meet the Taxonomy criteria for “manufacturing of hydrogen” activity (see 4.4), and of which the scope of lifecycle-emissions includes conversion and transport of hydrogen carriers are eligible as amber until the criteria determining the thresholds for conversion and transport of hydrogen carriers become available and introduced in the taxonomy. Once available, hydrogen storage systems could be considered green if green thresholds are met under ‘manufacturing of hydrogen’ activity, as well as future activities on ‘hydrogen conversion’ and ‘transportation of hydrogen carriers’. It is recommended that the inclusion of thresholds for conversion and transport of hydrogen carriers should happen before 2030. |                  |                                                                                                                                                                                              |

24Note: Generation of electricity from hydrogen is an inefficient process because the process involves using renewable energy to first produce hydrogen which is later reconverted to electricity. The reconversion process could be avoided by directly using the renewable energy produced. In Singapore, however, this is permitted due to the following conditions: i) On-site renewable energy production capacity is not sufficient to meet the demand, ii) There is no sufficient availability of renewable energy for purchase to meet the demand.

# Transport

Context efficiency measures and/or reduction of GHG emissions, the decarbonisation of the transport sector predominantly relies on the fast roll-out of zero-emission solutions and phase out of emissions-intensive technologies. Hence, selected activities within the transport sector do not have an Amber category, especially activities for which zero-emission alternatives exist. Thus, the Amber category is only available for heavy-duty vehicles, sea and coastal water transport, land water transport, and air transport.

The process of designing technical screening criteria also considered the key transport-related initiatives and targets announced by the Singapore Government, in support of its enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution, Long Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy, and the Singapore Green Plan26.

For shipping technical screening criteria for green category have been put forward based on Climate Bonds Initiative Criteria developed for the sector. The metrics used by CBI include Energy Efficiency Operational Index and The Annual Efficiency Ratio as defined by IMO. For Amber we refer to the emission reduction ambition levels devised by IMO. While it is not significant for Singapore itself, inland water transport has been included, given the objective of the Taxonomy to cater to the needs of the international financial institutions operating in Singapore.

Only existing projects are eligible in the Amber categories. The exception is for new projects in sea and coastal, and inland water transport Amber (measures) that have to demonstrate their ability to retrofitted to be Green-eligible before the sunset date, or can be switched to renewables – for e.g., dual-fuel vessels that can switch to renewables. New projects under Air Transport, Amber (measures) such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel are also allowed.

Sunset date at 2030 applies for amber category for sea and coastal transport for activities aligned with IMO pathways. Amber criteria for inland water transport will have to be revised, for the taxonomy to offer guidance on thresholds beyond 2025. Amber criteria for heavy-duty vehicles will have to be revised by 2030 the latest. Similarly, the sunset date stated under amber measures for air transport applies only to the stated criteria for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and not SAF as a measure. Appropriate thresholds for SAF will be considered in subsequent editions to reflect latest developments, recognizing that SAF is a key decarbonisation lever for the international aviation sector that will feature till 2050 and beyond and ICAO is still in the midst of developing an overall decarbonisation pathway for international aviation.

| ISIC Description       | This class includes: land transport of passengers by urban or suburban transport systems. This may include different modes of land transport, such as by motorbus, tramway, streetcar, trolley bus, underground and elevated railways etc. The transport is carried out on scheduled routes normally following a fixed time schedule, entailing the picking up and setting down of passengers at normally fixed stops. This class also includes town-to-airport or town-to-station lines; operation of funicular railways, aerial cableways etc. if part of urban or suburban transit systems. |

# Footnotes

32 Energy Efficiency Operational Index (EEOI): EEOI represents the CO2 emitted per tonne-nautical mile for a voyage or specific time period. It can either be calculated from fuel consumption measurements and information on cargo carried and distance travelled or estimated using satellite tracking data and fleet technical specifications. EEOI therefore accounts for the real operating conditions of the vessel and their impact on fuel consumption (e.g., speed, weather, draught).

30 Possible measures include but are not limited to those captured in Appendix M4 of the ICAO’s Report on the Feasibility of a Long-term Aspirational Goal. If the vessel operates 100% of the time on voyages that include the EU, then it must report using EEOI. Vessels which are not operating 100% of the time on voyages that include the EU can opt to report EEOI but are required to verify this data independently.

33 The Annual Efficiency Ratio (AER) measures carbon emissions associated with transport work, but it uses a ship’s size (deadweight) as a proxy for cargo carried and assumes that the ship is fully loaded on all journeys.

The activity complies with one of the following criteria:

- • Vessels achieve the levels of ambition set by the 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG emissions from Ships34 ; or

# 34Levels of ambition directing the 2023 IMO GHG strategy are as follows:

1. Carbon intensity of the ship to decline through further improvement of energy efficiency for new ships;
2. To reduce CO2 emissions per transport work, as an average across international shipping, by at least 40% by 2030, compared to 2008;
3. Uptake of zero or near-zero GHG emission technologies, fuels and/or energy sources to represent at least 5%, striving for 10%, of the energy used by international shipping by 2030; and
4. To peak GHG emissions from international shipping as soon as possible and to reach net zero by or around, i.e. close to, 2050

Further, the Strategy includes indicative checkpoints to reach net-zero GHG emissions from international shipping:

- 1. To reduce the total annual GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 20%, striving for 30%, by 2030, compared to 2008; and
- To reduce the total annual GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 70%, striving for 80%, by 2040, compared to 2008.

SINGAPORE - ASIA TAXONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE FINANCE | 2023

# 3 Real Estate/Construction

Context The extent to which non-energy related points can be awarded varies significantly depending on the scheme. Metrics for measuring buildings vary around the world and a key challenge for setting buildings criteria and thresholds in taxonomies is to maintain a balance between usability and interoperability. While this is a challenge throughout the Taxonomy, in the buildings sector it is particularly acute given that most regions or countries already have a local buildings code or standard that is already being used locally (although to different degrees around the world). To maintain usability, local standards need to be used to whatever extent possible while also recognising that some of them may be insufficient on their own.

Comparing buildings standards, codes and labels around the world is a huge challenge, not least because buildings labels are scoring methodologies which measure a range of different metrics. Some of these metrics are climate related (energy efficiency, emissions etc) while others are not directly (water consumption, recycling infrastructure etc.). As a result, a building with a high score may receive this for largely non-energy related reasons which would not be aligned with the objective (climate mitigation) in this Taxonomy.

# TSC overview and methodology

In the EU, the main metric is Primary Energy Demand (PED). The Taxonomy aims to set defined emissions intensity thresholds in line with Singapore’s transition pathway. Singapore’s Green Mark Certification is used in this Taxonomy as a key starting point; it is a rigorous and ambitious green building rating system to evaluate a building's environmental impact and performance with climate mitigation credentials that are broadly aligned with EU approach. It is seen as a highly ambitious scheme internationally and intends to align with the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG13 on climate action. It is also used as a benchmark for existing requirements and/or schemes; for example, it being used by GreenGov.SG for all new public sector buildings and existing public sector buildings under retrofit as a key enabler for the public sector to meet government sustainability targets.

| Ineligible | • Buildings dedicated to fossil fuel use (consistent with treatment of fossil fuels in energy; however, this would not apply to indirect activities e.g., a green building will be eligible even if rented by a fossil company).                                |                       |

# Activity technical screening criteria

To identify international proxies for eligibility, the Taxonomy has made use of the Climate Bonds Initiative research and criteria. This is kept up to date on the website. Some of the regional and international proxies are summarised here for easy viewing. Note that this is not comprehensive, and users are recommended to view the Climate Bonds website for up-to-date information39.

Context

According to IPCC AR6 report, in 2019, about 24% of anthropogenic GHG emissions came from the high-emitting industry sectors42. Once indirect emissions from energy use are considered that share increases to 34%. Over the last decade emissions from the industry (and transport) sector increased most rapidly.

Importantly, industry faces a dual challenge – on one hand, reducing its own emissions and on the other hand manufacturing the technological solutions that will play an enabling role in the emissions reduction in other areas of whole economy. Thus, it is necessary to steer financial flows both43:

- to the activities that have the highest share in the GHG emissions, (referred to as hard-to-abate activities)
- - e.g. manufacturing of iron and steel, of basic chemicals, cement, aluminium and hydrogen44

to the activities that have the highest share in the GHG emissions, (referred to as hard-to-abate activities)

The IPCC AR6 report highlights that the enormous challenge in achieving a net-zero objective in the coming decade. However, decarbonisation is not impossible, owing to ongoing technological developments, and broad adoption of mitigation, adaptation, and resilience measures across value chains.

The primary levers for decarbonisation include, among others:

- Electrification,
- Non-fossil-based inputs,
- Use of various low-carbon fuels (e.g. hydrogen) for heat applications,

Technical screening criteria – emission thresholds for sectors that are characterised by high GHG emissions (basic chemicals, steel, cement, hydrogen, aluminium) as have been developed based on the 1.5°C science-based decarbonisation pathways – an approach adapted from Climate Bonds Initiative’s criteria.

Given the broad scope covered by the manufacturing sectors please refer to detailed sectoral criteria, given that there might be some deviations from the outlined approach and methodology.

# Figure 8: Amber category for industry sectors

# Figure 7: Theoretical example of creation of how thresholds are put forward based on transition

EU Taxonomy thresholds have been used as a starting point for a pathway and the sectoral decarbonisation pathway has been transposed to this starting point to reach net zero by 2050 at the activity level. As far as possible, the thresholds have been projected into the future so that the user can see how the thresholds will change over time as they ratchet down towards 2050 (see Figure 7). This is an extension of the EU approach where the EU criteria are put forward for the current period with the understanding that these will be revised downwards every 5 years (to be confirmed). The approach is intended to provide greater certainty for users to see how activities need to decarbonise to remain green although it is noted that thresholds, particularly those further in the future, are based on today’s understanding of the future and what is possible, what may change as new technologies become available etc.

Wherever possible, science-based transition pathways have been adopted from other initiatives, which approach pathway development process with a high degree of scrutiny from academia and industry experts such as these developed by the IEA or the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi).

# Approach to setting TSC for high emitting sectors

Given the scale of the challenge associated with the decarbonisation of the selected industry sectors and lack of technologically and economically feasible low-carbon alternatives, these sectors have been defined as inherently “in transition”. Enabling sectors are those focused on manufacturing of net-zero aligned products and technologies. These sectors have TSC that are more qualitative and less dynamic – not associated directly with decarbonisation pathway, often introducing the links to criteria established for the associated economic activities. The Green thresholds adopted for these activities have been, in most cases, are from the EU Taxonomy.

This means that while in other sectors, it makes sense to create a line between ineligible and Amber performance, for most industry sectors, this line is problematic for a few reasons:

1. The data is not available to create a line with any credibility or science basis meaning that the line between ineligible and Amber would be arbitrary;
2. For many activities, performance at the activity level (or, in the case of industry, a plant or facility) will vary significantly but the aim is for all facilities to move to a Green transition pathway within a time period. The starting point is therefore not important compared to the movement towards green over time.

# Figure 9: Theory of change behind measures-based approach

This means that while in other sectors, it makes sense to create a line between ineligible and Amber performance, for most industry sectors, this line is problematic for a few reasons:

# Companies decarbonise by...

...decarbonising their activities which can be decarbonised by...

# ...implementing individual measures

## Page 34

SINGAPORE - ASIA TAXONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE FINANCE | 2023

Impact on usability of measures-based approach – promoting planning focused on alignment of the activity with the decarbonisation pathway, for the measures-based approach, the requirement of the 1.5°C-aligned transition plan has been introduced. We recommend for the transition plans to be prepared in line with Transition Finance Principles outlined by the IPSF. While today the requirement is for the entities to develop 1.5°C-aligned transition plan, likely, with future revisions of the Taxonomy, further provisions regarding the contents and level of ambition might be introduced.

The Amber category that applies to investment measures cannot, however, be used to assess revenues. It can only be used for the purpose of defining the alignment of CapEx. Such an approach has a major upside in that by acknowledging individual decarbonisation efforts rather than solely end-effects, it could help fast-track emissions reduction from hard-to-abate sectors. To further leverage that effect, TSC require that measures are implemented by 2035, limiting the timeframe for enabling meaningful, but nevertheless insufficient, from the net-zero perspective, improvements. This short-term period aims to offer an opportunity to reward positive climate impacts, while low and zero-emission technologies remain under-developed and expensive.

In most cases, there is no Amber category but new activities, and thus manufacturing of associated new products and technologies, have to meet thresholds set for Green category. Activities that do not meet Green TSC are classified as Ineligible activities.

Interoperability with Climate Bonds Initiative and EU Taxonomies – rationale for selection of pathways designed by Climate Bonds Initiative. Additionally, CBI criteria offer increased stringency due to the presence of cross-cutting requirements focused on e.g. feedstock or energy-used.

The Taxonomy proposes different criteria for CapEx (Amber measures) and for revenue (Amber activities). These are potentially eligible for Amber category within sustainable finance (noting that some international investors may choose not to invest in Amber) for a labelled bond. However, revenues generated from the activity will not be eligible as Amber activities under any disclosure guidelines/requirements until they meet the Amber thresholds.

However, to increase interoperability between taxonomies, EU thresholds have been used as a starting point for ratcheting ambition up to net zero. Such approach encourages also pro-active uptake of global decarbonisation pathways (e.g. IEA’s) by CBI criteria helps to ensure their universal application and thorough engagement of technical and industry experts in the criteria development process enhances their usability by stakeholders.

Reference: Green: Pathway based on a starting point (in 2020) of the EU Taxonomy thresholds for cement. Sectoral decarbonisation pathway from Science-Based Targets Initiative has been applied to this starting point to reach net zero by 2050. Pathway followed and relevant references for projection of the thresholds has been described in detail in section 4.3.1. of the CBI’s Cement Criteria Background Paper.

The following emissions should be accounted for when comparing to the thresholds in Table 10.

- Nitric acid, and soda ash: Scope 1 emissions which include all direct emissions from the production processes: emissions generated during the chemical reactions, emissions from fuel combustion on-site.
- Carbon black, HVC and aromatics: Scope 1 as defined above, plus Scope 2 emissions which includes indirect emissions from the energy imported from off-site.
- Methanol and ammonia: GHG emissions are for the lifecycle emissions of hydrogen used as feedstock.
- Chlorine: The benchmark is for the electricity intensity of the process. No GHG accounting is required for chlorine. Following 2040, electricity must be from renewable sources.

Traffic Light Criteria

Green: Facility must comply with the following headline requirements:

- Activities need to meet specific emissions intensity thresholds defined in Table 11. More detailed calculations and methodology can be found in Appendix A.
- And if facilities are using biomass, hydrogen, or waste as a fuel source they are eligible only if they meet the following criteria:

And if the plant uses Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) equipment on site, it must comply with Taxonomy criteria for CCS Storage (Green category).

Context and methodology notes

Most new steel plants built today will still be online in 2050. There are already low-carbon steel production technologies available, and it is expected that more will become commercially ready before and beyond 2030.

Since steel production facilities can operate for many years, new facilities should already be built with CO2 emissions mitigation technologies in place or avoiding CO2 generation entirely by limiting the use of fossil fuels. The technical challenges are such that this is very important at the design stage – if a plant is not designed to have, for example, CCS implemented, it is very difficult to retrofit later.

To acknowledge and promote the decarbonisation efforts, (new and existing) facilities that do not meet criteria designed for Green category at the outset but have been designed to and envisage full alignment over time and by 2030 latest, can be classified as Amber.

At the same time, current technologies for refurbishment cannot bring long-existing Blast Furnace-Basic Oxygen Furnace (BF-BOF) plants in line with a 1.5°C pathway. These are old technologies and retrofit opportunities are limited. Such plants will need to be phased out in the long term. However, in many cases, short term emissions can be reduced to the levels required in 2030 – these should be maximised. When looking at existing facilities, the criteria below aim to avoid investments that would lock-in heavy emitting technologies, without overlooking those producers that will make credible efforts to reduce their current emissions.

Literature review shows that around 71% of steel’s global coal-based capacity will require reinvestment by 2030. Steel producers can either invest in ‘relining’ (extension of a life-span of the investment) or switch to alternative technologies. Relining is discouraged within these criteria as it risks locking-in assets that are not compatible with a low-carbon future. Consequently, we have limited the age of eligible blast furnaces.

# 4.4. Manufacture of hydrogen

Traffic Light Criteria

Green: Facility must comply with the following requirements:

- Hydrogen production must meet specific carbon intensity thresholds (Table 14).
- To demonstrate compliance with any of the emissions intensity thresholds set in Table 14, issuers are required to carry out a lifecycle assessment (see Appendix N).
- Facilities must meet the requirements listed in Table 24 in Appendix N depending on the feedstock and:
- - a. The feedstock is not coal or coal derivatives.
- b. Biomass from primary sources is not eligible as a feedstock. Wood and other dedicated crops are not eligible (only waste biomass sources are eligible).

Facilities must meet the requirements listed in Table 24 in Appendix N for different electricity sources.
- Facilities using CCS or CCU must meet the criteria in Table 24 in Appendix N. Facilities that meet the specific intensity thresholds presented in Table 24 in Appendix N, do not have to meet the following requirements associated with CCS/CCU listed in Table 24 in Appendix N: The minimum capture rate from process and energy emission streams should be 90% or emissions reduction at the facility level have to be at least of 50%.

Forestry
# Context

The forestry sector has immense potential to provide environmental services that are extremely important in the fight against climate change. Forestry can also play an important role in the local economy through sustainable and regenerative systems. Forests can not only sequester and mitigate emissions of GHG, but they also play an important role in keeping biodiversity assets intact.

Afforestation, reforestation, and forest management to maximise carbon sequestration are recognised as key strategies for climate change mitigation in line with a 1.5°C pathway through removing CO2 from the atmosphere and slowing global warming. However, the actual mitigation effect of forestry activities is influenced by many factors, such as location, scale and management effectiveness.

Climate change mitigation in the forestry sector is also strongly linked to avoiding deforestation and land-use change. Peat fires are also a major contributor to GHG emissions in Indonesia (40% of the total in 2005 and, in 2015, rivalling daily emissions in the U.S.) and could add an estimated 1 billion tons to the country’s carbon footprint. The total carbon content of forests has been estimated at 861Gt of carbon for 2011, which is more than the amount of carbon in the entire atmosphere. According to the IPCC in its Sixth Assessment Report, reducing and/or preventing deforestation is the mitigation option with the largest and most immediate carbon stock impact in the short term.

# TSC overview and methodology

Due to the diversity embedded in the forestry sector, the approach to identifying green agricultural practices and activities does not consider quantitative metrics and/or criteria. Instead, it classifies activities and sub-activities according to the “traffic light” methodology where green are activities that are encouraged, amber are activities that should either be phased out or changed over time, while the rest are considered ineligible activities. This approach is similar to the one used for the construction of the Colombian Taxonomy.

# Categorisation of activities

For the forestry sector, it is possible to group activities in three big groups, defined by the objectives and outputs of each operation in the sector. The activities here have been mapped and grouped as follows:

- Sustainable forest management – a system that ensures that forests supply goods and services meet both present-day and future needs and contribute to the sustainable development of communities;
- Forestry plantation – type of managed forest in which the trees are planted (as opposed to naturally regenerated), of the same age and generally of the same species, and are intended to maximise the production of wood fibre;
- Conservation, restoration and maintenance – actions needed to protect and assure that environmental services are provided by natural/pristine forests.

# How to use these criteria

The criteria have been designed to be applicable to granular green activities as well as to the wider level. For example, some of the criteria are suitable for green use of proceeds instruments, such as green bonds, where a bond is raised for a specific project or asset (e.g. nurseries) while others (e.g. the proxy certification standards) are applicable at the forestry project level and could be used as part of corporate disclosure to classify green revenues. Note that for an activity to be effectively considered as green, it should be in line with the relevant related guidelines in one or more of the listed credible certification schemes (e.g. Forest Stewardship Council – FSC and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification – PEFC).

52 Nurseries are defined any facility designated to produce tree seedlings grown under favourable conditions until they are ready for planting.

53 Integrated Farm Management (IFM) is a site specific farm business approach that uses the best of modern technology and traditional methods (as defined by IFMA).

54 Biocontrol comprises using living organisms or natural substances to prevent or reduce damage caused by harmful organisms (animal pests, weeds and pathogens).

55 High carbon stock (HCS) land assessment was developed for the purpose of avoiding land use change due to oil palm conversion that resulted in net carbon losses. As a result, any land use with more than the average C stock per hectare of oil palm, i.e., more than 35tC/ha, is considered high carbon stock. Forest classification types can be used as a proxy for the classification. For example, in Indonesia, lands classified as “Mostly young re-growth forest, but with occasional patches of older forest within the stratum,” or above in terms of biomass are considered HCS land.

Carbon Capture and Storage

Context There is no universally adopted classification of CCS activities and no ISIC codes for them, but based on the examples of other taxonomies (Climate Bonds, EU and South Africa) activities can be classified the following way:

# Carbon capture and storage/sequestration (CCS)

CCS is the process of capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) before it enters the atmosphere, transporting it and storing it in underground geological formations. CCS includes a range of different process and technology options to capture and store CO2. According to IEA, CCS is an important decarbonisation lever for hard-to-abate sectors and will contribute to achieving global climate goals.

Singapore is studying emerging low-carbon technologies such as Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS). This includes the study “Carbon Capture, Storage, and Utilisation: Decarbonisation Pathways for Singapore’s Energy and Chemicals Sectors”59 which was commissioned by the government and concluded in June 2021. Singapore does not have any known suitable reservoirs for the permanent storage of CO2 in its subsurface, but analysis of the geological storage potential in neighbouring countries indicates an estimated regional storage potential of 84.8 Giga tons60 (Singapore’s annual emissions are approximately 0.5 Gigatons61. Currently, Singapore is targeting at least 2 million tons of carbon capture by 2030 and more than 6 million tons/year by 2050, as it transforms its Jurong Island downstream oil hub into an energy and chemicals park.

As a relatively mature technology, CCS is gaining traction as a decarbonisation lever in recent decades. However, scientists have exercised caution in promoting the role of CCS across the economy. While it is broadly agreed that CCS will play a role, there remain economic viability constraints, uncertainty around the long term nature of storage and limits to storage reservoirs and capacity (in the short-to medium term).

# Classification of CCS Activities

- Point-source capture of CO2 is the process of capturing CO2 from a large emissions source – e.g. an industrial facility. Most CCS projects utilise point source capture given the higher concentrations of CO2 make the capture process more efficient. Point-source capture is listed here for completeness of the process but it cannot be viewed as a standalone activity because it is never carried out separately from a certain industrial or power generation activity. Its main goal is to decrease the emissions of the activity it is linked to. Point-source capture is not a separate activity in other taxonomies and is mostly mentioned in this Taxonomy as a part of industrial activities criteria.
- Transportation of captured CO2 can be done by various means, including pipelines, ships, railroad cisterns or trucks.
- Permanent sequestration of captured CO2 includes injecting of CO2, removed by point- or direct air capture of CO2 within an underground geological formation, whereby the fraction of carbon dioxide stored through mineral carbonation that is retained after 1000 years is virtually certain to be 100%. As a consequence, the need for monitoring the disposal sites will be limited in the case of mineral carbonation (IPCC Special Report).
- Research, development and innovation for CCS-related technologies. Research activities that are related to CCS are included in the Taxonomy to underline the importance of the development of this field.

TSC overview and methodology

• Permanent sequestration of captured CO2:

• Utilisation of CO2

Metrics used: Proper arrangement of the geological formation for CO2 storage, the establishment of reliable surveillance systems and prevention of leakage are key metrics in assessing the efficiency of sequestration.

• Point-source capture of CO2: compatibility of the targeted industrial or power generation activity with the corresponding green criteria elsewhere in taxonomy.

Captured CO2 may either be transported and stored or used on-site by industrial processes that require a source of carbon. Huge quantities of CO2 are currently used each year, mainly in the fertiliser industry and for enhanced oil recovery while new utilisation pathways in the production of CO2-based synthetic fuels, chemicals and building aggregates are gaining momentum. For these reasons, the precautionary principle was applied, and utilisation is not eligible within this Taxonomy. This may well change in the future as clearer guidelines become available.

SINGAPORE - ASIA TAXONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE FINANCE | 2023

Information and Communications Technology

Context

ICT is one of the key enabling sectors in the ASEAN, EU, SA, Indonesian and other taxonomies. Although not usually high-emitting itself (there is almost no Scope 1 emission, only Scope 2 and 3 emission), this sector is important for digital transformation and the improvement of efficiency of activities in emissions-intensive sectors. Today roughly over 2% of all emissions in the world can be attributed to ICT sector, but this figure will grow in the future as demand increases. Even as emissions from the sectors rise, a report by the Global e-Sustainability Initiative estimates that IT solutions can help cut nearly 10 times more CO2 than they emit.

Under the ISIC code, Section J, ICT includes publishing activities, telecommunications and data processing and hosting activities. Most ICT activities have limited climate impact and they are not generally included in major taxonomies. For the Singapore Taxonomy, the GFIT selected data centres as the most important activities within the ICT sector for emission reductions within the Singapore Taxonomy.

# TSC overview and methodology

Singapore context

Singapore has, in the last decade, become a major hub for data centres within the ASEAN region. In the country itself they account for 7% of total energy requirements. As data centres are intensive users of resources like land, water and energy, the Government informed the industry of a temporary pause in the growth of DCs in 2019 and embarked on a review. The pause was lifted in 2022 with the launch of pilot Data Centre – Call for Application (DC-CFA) exercise that invited innovative proposals from the industry. Together they consume almost 7% of the country's total energy requirements. This number is expected to hit 12% by 2030.

In simple terms, data centre activities can be divided into two parts: the hardware and software. The hardware component covers construction, as well as storage, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or processing of data through data centres.

The Government has recently announced that it will award 80MW of new capacity to four data centre operators selected through the pilot DC-CFA exercise, where the selected data center operators proposed sustainability measures such as achieving PUE of 1.3 or lower, as well as a Platinum rating under the Green Mark Scheme for New Data Centres.

Metrics for data centres reduce the emissions of a data centre. The GWP of refrigerants applies the same criteria across Green and Amber due to low cost of complying with it and huge negative effect in case if it is relaxed. Concerning the software and solutions, the final decision on the compatibility can be made only after the final choice of “substantial contribution” definition is made. The EU Taxonomy solves this issue by stating that “where an alternative solution/technology is already available on the market, the ICT solution demonstrates substantial lifecycle GHG emission savings compared to the best performing alternative solution/technology. Lifecycle GHG emissions and net emissions are calculated using Recommendation 2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using ETSI ES 203 199, ISO 14067:2018 or ISO 14064-2:2019. Quantified lifecycle GHG emission reductions are verified by an independent third party which transparently assesses how the standard criteria, including those for critical review, have been followed when the value was derived.

Recent developments in the IT sector also launched a movement for “greening of IT” itself in order to improve energy efficiency of IT solutions, maximise their use, minimise their carbon footprint and meet compliance requirements. Development of such software is a nascent field. These solutions make lesser impact on Taxonomy’s objectives but is also important. Thus, it is added as Amber criteria-compliant activity without any additional thresholds.

# Energy sourcing

Replacement of fossil fuels generation with renewables generations can help further reduce scope 2 emissions, especially once marginal efficiency gains become more expensive to improve.

# Refrigerant Global warming potential (GWP)

Refrigerants that are used within data centres are liquids or a gas with a very low boiling point. Refrigerants, such as hydrofluorocarbons, and fire suppressants are powerful greenhouse gases with global warming potential (GWP) hundreds to thousands of times more potent per unit than carbon dioxide. Their effect on climate is measured in GWP units where lower GWP refrigerants can.

The EU Taxonomy provides criteria both for data centres and software, and in overwhelming majority of cases they are compatible with the ones.

71 The most updated scheme as of this current Taxonomy iteration is the BCA-IMDA Green Mark for New Data Centres (2019). For the Platinum rating, PUE thresholds are: 1.50 at 25% IT load; 1.45 at 50% IT load; 1.39 at 75% IT load; 1.35 at 100% IT load.

72 In Singapore, under the Environmental Protection and Management Act (EPMA), the GWP of refrigerant used in electrically driven water-cooled chillers with cooling capacity of 1,055kW or more that is used for one or more purposes that include producing chilled water for air-conditioning must not exceed the prescribed GWP limit of 15. This includes water-cooled chillers that produce chilled water for the cooling of data server halls/rooms and office spaces in data centres.

# Waste

# Context

Since 2001, the National Recycling Programme (NRP) has been in place which collects commingled recyclables (paper, plastic, glass and metals) in a blue recycling bin for materials recovery. The Code of Practice on Environmental Health (COPEH), provides guidelines to address environmental health concerns in the design of buildings, and stipulates minimum design criteria on refuse and recyclables collection.

In Singapore, around 6.94MTs of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) was generated in 2021, with an overall recycling rate of 55%. Most of the waste is attributed to non-domestic sources (74%), and around 80% of total MSW is treated by Waste-to-Energy (WtE) plants (NEA, 2022). Currently, there are four WtE plants, a transfer station and one offshore landfill. Given Singapore’s land constraints, there is limited space inland for additional MSW facilities. Nonetheless, Singapore aims to be a zero-waste nation by strengthening its climate, resource and economic resilience and adopt a circular economy approach to sustainable waste and resource management (NEA, 2022).

The Singapore Taxonomy for the Waste sector is developed for Singapore-based Financial Institutions (FIs) to guide business activities in

| Most      | Prevention |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Preferred | Re-use     |
|           | Recycling  |
|           | Recovery   |
| Least     | Disposal   |

Singapore and regionally. It includes key activities to ensure better and efficient recycling. WtE has been included considering the local context, however, the thresholds are strict to ensure that only efficient plants are considered. Additionally, direct disposal of waste at WtE plants without pre-sorting or segregating of recyclables is not considered under Green or Amber categories. The sunset date for Amber for activities under the Waste sector will be until 2030 unless stated otherwise. Residual waste refers to non-recyclable fraction of the waste. Segregation refers to separating waste into different fractions such as biowaste, recyclables, etc.

- Collection and transport of non-hazardous waste
- Biowaste treatment: composting of biowaste
- Biowaste treatment: anaerobic digestion
- Waste-to-Energy (WtE)
- Landfill gas capture and utilisation (not directly applicable to Singapore)
- Material recovery facilities

The metrics chosen for activities related to collection and transportation and biological treatment of waste (composting and anaerobic digestion) are qualitative, as the climate mitigation effect is an inherent result of the economic activities. The mitigation of GHG emissions occur by the process of transformation of waste into by-products such as biogas or compost. The collection and transportation of waste to recycling facilities enables recycling and material recovery. However, the metrics include ensuring quality checks on the processes such as methane leakage monitoring, adequate use of by-products, ensuring sorting of waste, among others.

- Collection and transportation of non-hazardous waste that is segregated at source or at an intermediate sorting facility that is intended for preparation for reuse or recycling operations, and
- Includes waste collection containers, transfer stations, transportation vehicles and other related infrastructure.

# Amber

The activity complies with the following criteria:

- Collection and transportation of non-hazardous waste for energy recovery directly without any material recovery for recycling, and
- Includes waste collection equipment and other related infrastructure.

# Ineligible

The activity complies with the following criteria:

- Collection and transportation of non-hazardous waste directly for disposal to landfills, and
- Does not include adequate equipment for collections and transportation.

We note here that in Singapore’s context, waste is first sent for incineration, and the incineration ash is subsequently landfilled together with non-incinerable waste. Landfilling of waste with methane capture has been included here as it provides guidance for such projects at the regional level.

For WtE plants, the net thermal efficiency of the plants is expected to be above 25% and the bottom ash recovery of metal is expected to be at least 75% for Green classification, as this ensures net GHG emissions through enhanced energy recovery. Similarly, the green criteria for Material recovery facilities is expected to be above 50%, so as to have significant material recovery that can foster a sustainable waste value chain, with economically feasible and environmentally supportive recycling sector. The 50% efficiency in intermediate sorting also prevents majority of waste entering the landfill and allows for net GHG emission reductions.

# TSC overview and methodology

The criteria for the sector considers the waste management hierarchy to ensure adequate management of the MSW by prioritising recycling over energy recovery or landfilling. Separation at source or at an intermediate facility are promoted to enhance recovery and recycling, as well as lower GHG emissions.

# 9 Water

The water sector is intrinsically integrated and interrelated with other sectors, and across every Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). Investment in water sector is pivotal to building climate resilience across sectors and strengthening international peace and security. The World Bank estimates that sustained negative growth will occur in some regions due to water related losses in agriculture, health, income and property (World Bank, 2016).

Water and energy use are also highly correlated. Reducing leakages and increasing energy efficiency are also important to meeting climate mitigation goals. This is particularly important in the desalination process which is energy intensive or where water is transported over great distances. For example, in California, the water system uses approximately 20% of the state’s electricity and 30% of its natural gas to pump, convey, treat, and heat water75.

At the same time, poor access to safe drinking water and sanitation can lead to innumerable premature deaths and negatively affect a region’s economy. The activities within the water sector for a sustainable finance Taxonomy shall primarily involve processes for efficient design of water collection, treatment, supply and wastewater treatment, with specific focus on increasing energy efficiency and reducing leakage losses.

In Singapore, current water demand is 440 million gallons per day (mgd). This is set to almost double by 2065, with the non-domestic sector being the major source of demand growth, increasing from about half of our total water consumption today to about two-thirds by 2065. The increase in water demand would be met by the installation, upgrading and effective operation of NEWater, desalination plants and distribution network (PUB, 2022).

In Singapore, rainwater and used water are collected and conveyed through separate systems, ensuring that our waterways are free of pollution. Rainwater collected in local catchment areas is stored in 17 reservoirs and treated at our local waterworks to produce potable water. It is then distributed through 6,600km of pipeline network to both households and industries.

Used water is collected via 3,600km of public sewers and deep tunnel sewerage systems and is sent to the four water reclamation plants for treatment (PUB, 2022). The treated used water effluent is further purified using advanced membrane technologies and ultra-violet disinfection to produce NEWater at NEWater plants. Singapore also has desalination plants which produce potable water.

Singapore is a compact city state that is highly urbanised and densely populated. Singapore has the third highest population density in the world at 8,377 people/km2 and is one of the most water stressed countries in the world due to a lack of land to store and capture rainfall. Hence, the operating conditions of water and wastewater treatment infrastructure face unique challenges such as urbanised watershed as well as the lack of space for water infrastructure and deployment of renewable energy sources.

Competing land use compels Singapore to build deeper or multi-storey plants. For example, the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS) project allows used water to be conveyed by gravity to centralised water reclamation plants and frees up some 880 hectares of land for higher value land use. However, this necessitates the construction of deeper Influent Pumping Stations (IPS) to pump used water from some 50-60m deep to the treatment processes in the centralised water reclamation plants.

Over the years, PUB has developed NEWater and desalinated seawater as two additional National Taps to enhance Singapore’s water resilience. Technological advancement, such as Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) has made wastewater treatment processes more land efficient.

efficient, as there is no longer a need for large secondary sedimentation tanks in the Water Reclamation Plants (WRPs). In addition, MBR produces treated effluent that is of much better quality than that required to meet local discharge standards, and consistent and reliable supply of NEWater. In the context of NEWater production in Singapore, MBR also allows the overall treatment efficiency of water reuse to be improved, as the conventional treatment processes in a WRP and a NEWater Factory are shortened by two processes, saving both land and treatment costs.

The activities in water sector for Singapore have been defined as follows:

- Plants: Construction, extension and operation of new water collection and treatment systems
- Plants: Renewal of water collection and treatment systems
- Distribution network: Construction, extension and operation of new water collection and treatment systems
- Distribution network: Renewal of water collection and treatment systems (distribution networks)
- Plants: Construction, extension and operation of wastewater collection and treatment
- Collection network: Renewal of wastewater collection and treatment
- Plants: Desalination systems

The activities align with ISIC — Section E: Water supply, Sewerage, Waste Management and Remediation Activities. The Water collection, treatment and supply related activities align with E3600 and Wastewater sewerage related activities align with E3700.

*The thresholds for distribution networks are based on reducing leakages in the systems for the segment of the network that is renewed.

The threshold for desalination systems is aligned to Climate Bonds and EU criteria, wherein the average carbon intensity of energy used to power the plant must be at or below 100gCO2e/kWh over the remaining lifetime of the asset. Desalination plants can meet the thresholds through reduction in carbon intensity of energy source and/or through improvements in energy efficiency.

Both new and existing projects are considered in the Amber category. The sunset date for Amber activities under the Water sector will be 2035 unless stated otherwise.

# Agriculture

Context absence of agreed definitions mean that the risk of incremental changes to business-as-usual and of greenwashing is substantial. The goal of this document is to provide a common understanding on low-carbon agricultural operations for the Singapore context as a guide for the financial sector.

# Levers for reducing emissions from the agriculture sector

For the following agriculture criteria, the focus is on reducing the GHG emissions relating to agriculture. There are a number of levers available to reduce emissions from agriculture which we are trying to target through these criteria. These include, but are not limited to:

- Less emission intensive crops and animal production
- Reduced use of chemicals
- Increased use of bio solution
- Use of organic fertilisers
- Use of low-carbon equipment
- Better monitoring of environmental conditions
- Plant breeding dedicated to achieve better yields and resilience

There are, of course, other environmental goals that are important when referring to agriculture — such as reduced leaching of chemicals etc. Where these are aligned with climate goals, they are also tackled here but they are not the focus on this phase of work.

To safeguard Singapore’s food security, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) adopts a multi-pronged approach which includes diversifying food import sources and increasing local production. SFA also takes a risk-based approach to food safety which is guided by science and consistent with international standards. SFA has in place an integrated farm-to-fork food safety system to ensure that food is safe for consumption.

More than 90% of Singapore’s food supply is imported, with only about 1% of Singapore’s land set aside for agricultural use. Given Singapore's heavy reliance on imports, a key strategy to enhance its food security is import source diversification.

In addition, local farms play an important role in the nation’s food security as local production serves as a buffer by reducing dependence on imports during supply disruptions. The local agri-food sector is predominantly made up of farms, producing hen shell eggs, vegetables, and seafood.

However, the agri-food industry in Singapore is nascent where land and resource constraints have prompted farms to adapt technology and innovative ways to ‘grow more with less’, in a sustainable way. In consultation with the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), context was provided by SFA in terms of its work to anchor high productivity farming players in our local ecosystem. Our farms are harnessing technology and innovation to strive towards productivity, climate-resilience and resource efficiency. These farms are also able to employ climate control technologies, increasing their resilience to climate changes.

# Criteria for Protected Agriculture and Water Infrastructure for best practices

- Agricultural equipment powered by renewable energy; or
- Agriculture equipment that appears amongst the most resource efficient in the country e.g. in terms of electricity, water, land, labour efficiency; or
- Low-carbon crop management: regenerative agriculture, organic farming, precision agriculture, agroforestry, controlled environments, as certified by eligible schemes (see list aside).
- Use of organic and biofertilisers; or
- Use of physical and biocontrol of pathogens, pests and weeds; or
- Nurseries related to low-carbon crop management; or
- Adoption and maintenance of monitoring and tracking technology (with the goal of enhancing predictability and precision in agricultural operation, and thus being a resilience and adaptation measure); or
- Use of superior inputs which enables production with less resources e.g. superior seeds obtained through plant breeding (conventional breeding and genetic engineering with focus on productivity and resilience).

# TSC overview and methodology

Due to the diverse characteristics of agricultural operations, the approach to identifying green agricultural practices and activities does not easily lend itself to quantitative metrics and/or thresholds. Instead, it classifies activities and sub-activities according to the “traffic light” methodology where green are activities that are encouraged, amber are activities that should either be phased out or changed over a period of time, while the rest are considered ineligible activities. This approach is similar to the one used for the construction of the Colombian Taxonomy.

Each bullet on the list represents a credible certification scheme most adapted to certify one or more activities listed on the left column (e.g. sugarcane production — Bonsucro certification scheme). Eligible Green activities should adopt guidelines from one or more of the listed schemes.

Each bullet on the list is eligible on its own unless otherwise stated. The sunset date for Amber activities under the Agriculture sector will be until 2030 unless stated otherwise. New projects/measures are eligible under the Amber category.

Note: that there is currently very limited guidance on protected agriculture around the world, criteria may be used as a proxy until additional guidance becomes available.

Taxonomy in Practice

# Preamble

A key principle of this Taxonomy is that of the interoperability with other regional and national taxonomies. Capital is global, as are capital market participants, and it is therefore important that the Taxonomy is both consistent and compatible with other taxonomies, particularly the EU Taxonomy and the ASEAN Taxonomy. In drafting the Taxonomy, the approach, metrics and language adopted should be similar to other taxonomies. In particular, the structural underpinnings of this Taxonomy will be seen to be largely consistent with the EU Taxonomy.

While the Taxonomy represents current thinking around climate, transition, and activity thresholds, it is not designed to be static. It is not only permissible, but also desirable, that the Taxonomy be iterated in the future to reflect new initiatives and understandings, particularly in regard to the thresholds used for transition. Thresholds that are viewed as appropriate in this version may be less appropriate in years to come, and as such periodic updates will be necessary.

# Mandatory use of the Taxonomy

It is important to note that the Taxonomy is not mandatory or contained in any regulation at the time of publishing. It is intended to be voluntary for use in the first years as adoption grows. The following sections outline how the Taxonomy could be used by different users now and in the future.

# Users of the Taxonomy

By business line: it is anticipated that Singapore-based Financial Institutions providing debt and/or equity capital, including both public and private capital, would be the primary users of the Taxonomy; while it can also be used by companies, regulators, policymakers, and other financial market participants that need to define green activities.

# Primary Users: Financial Market Participants

a. Financial Institutions: These are intended as the primary users of the Taxonomy and include equity fund management, debt fund management, alternative investment management, private equity, venture capital, infrastructure financing, investment-linked insurance products, among others (see full list below).

While these would be the primary, direct users of the Taxonomy, the ultimate end “users” would be the clients of the Financial Institutions outlined above. The Taxonomy is designed to assist in their decision making when allocating capital to financial institutions, investment funds and other vehicles that are aligned with their overall environmental objectives and the long-term development of a green, sustainable economy.

# Secondary Users: Companies, Industry Regulators and Policymakers

a. Companies: Companies can use the Taxonomy to help align their businesses to green economic activities, which may help them access green financing opportunities, bring sustainable investment opportunities to the market, and/or help them in their investment decisions. Taxonomy reporting can also be harmonised with reporting for other frameworks, including TCFD, CDP, and SBTi, to provide a comprehensive assessment of a company’s performance on sustainability and environmental objectives.

b. Financial Service Providers: The Taxonomy can also be used by providers of services.

83 This geographic scope would refer to the nexus of operations, rather than strict issuer-driven geographic classification. For example, entities incorporated in Cayman but with substantial or an overwhelming majority of operations in ASEAN would be covered.

to these financial institutions and companies, investment and promote financing to support Singapore’s main environmental objectives.

Financial institutions

b. Performance against the technical screening criteria, or environmental management data where this is an acceptable proxy for compliance with the technical screening criteria – including DNSH assessment;

c. Management data on social issues: Labour rights policies, management systems, audits, reporting.

While the Taxonomy is not mandated for any institutions at the time of publishing, Financial Institutions can use it to report on the degree to which their investments, products or range of transactions (in the case of single loans, etc.) are aligned with the Taxonomy and the environmental objectives to which the undertaking contributes.

In doing so, the Financial Institution can assess the alignment (or percentage alignment) of the activity or issuer being financed, aggregate these alignments to the portfolio or product level, and disclose aggregate alignment accordingly.

At present, there is limited company disclosure on the breakdown of a company’s revenue, capital expenditures and operating expenditures by activity level and, by extension, its alignment with the Taxonomy technical screening criteria. Additional company disclosure will therefore be required to determine an issuers’ actual alignment with the overall environmental objectives and threshold.

An economic activity is considered eligible to the Taxonomy if included in the technical annex. An economic activity is considered to be aligned to the Taxonomy when it can demonstrate it meets the technical screening criteria. DNSH criteria are best efforts disclosure in the initial years of taxonomy implementation.

a. Revenue breakdown by Taxonomy-eligible activities, or capital expenditure (CapEx) and/or operating expenditure (OpEx) allocation to each Taxonomy-eligible activity;

b. International investments which do not meet the Green or Amber Taxonomy technical screening criteria will be classed as Ineligible under the Taxonomy classification.

For international investments that do not fall into the scope of the Taxonomy, these will be classed as Ineligible under the Taxonomy.

# Sector Reporting

The chapter in the Taxonomy on Sectors deals in more detail with the sector classification system chosen, and the sectors covered by the Taxonomy. The ISIC system has been selected as a starting point for the Taxonomy development as it is comprehensive in its coverage of economic sectors worldwide. It is acknowledged that many financial market participants use other classification systems, such as the Global Industry Classification System (GICS) or Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB), and a mapping of alternative classification systems to the selected ISIC sectors will be provided.

# Definitions

# What is an activity?

a. An activity refers to an economic activity as categorised using the UN ISIC framework.

When a company offers goods or services, it is performing an economic activity. The universe of economic activities is described using ISIC codes, which cover 21 broad sectors and with four further levels of differentiation. At the fourth level, 615 classes of economic activity are identified. The ISIC codes map directly to the EU’s NACE classification system. Any economic activities that are not directly covered by ISIC codes, such as buildings, have been identified as a cross-cutting activity for both climate change mitigation and adaptation, in line with the EU Taxonomy.

# What is revenue?

Revenue or net turnover means the amounts derived from the sale of products and the provision of services after deducting sales rebates and value added tax and other taxes directly linked to turnover. Overall turnover is equivalent to a firm’s total revenues over a defined period. Turnover ratios are used by financial analysts to understand a company’s efficiency and profitability based on data found in financial statements.

# What is CapEx?

Capital expenditure (CapEx) is a payment for goods or services recorded, or capitalised, on the balance sheet instead of expensed on the income statement.

Use: Aside from helping investors analyse a company’s investment in its existing and new fixed assets, capital expenditures can give an indication of a company’s strategy for improving environmental performance and resilience.

# What is OpEx?

Operating expenses (OpEx) are shorter-term expenses required to meet the ongoing operational costs of running a business.

# Green, Amber &#x26; Ineligible activities classification

The chapter of the Taxonomy on Classification deals in more detail with the way that green, amber and ineligible activities should be assessed in the context of alignment and the technical screening criteria. This Taxonomy by design allows for capital to be deployed in a way that recognises the differing economic, social, and technological contexts of ASEAN member states, and acknowledges that capital being deployed to make substantial (but alone insufficient) progress towards a desired end-state is both legitimate and desirous.

# Step by step guide

- An assessment of the activity or issuer being financed.
- Three tiers of assessment: activity, project, and company/issuer (please refer to Definitions box for more detail).

Figure 14: Step by Step Guide to Taxonomy Assessment

• If the eligible activity is not aligned with either the Green or Amber technical screening criteria, it is classified as Ineligible under the Taxonomy.

• If the eligible activity already meets the Green technical screening criteria for at least one of the five environmental objectives, then it can be considered to be aligned as a Green activity under the Taxonomy as long as it also does no significant harm to the other four environmental objectives and complies with minimum social safeguards.

Note: At present, the Taxonomy only covers climate change mitigation as an Environmental Objective, with the remaining four expected to be added in future iterations of the Taxonomy. As such, activities, projects and a company/issuer can only currently be classified as being aligned with climate change mitigation, although DNSH criteria should be considered for all of the remaining four Environmental Objectives. DNSH requirements are detailed in its own chapter.

# Economic Activity Eligibility and Alignment

Eligibility under the Taxonomy is assessed by economic activity according to its ISIC Classification (see Appendices for more details). Economic activities will be classed as ‘Ineligible’ under the Taxonomy if the economic activity does not fall within the scope of the Taxonomy.

• Determine the extent to which the company/issuer’s activities fall within one of the target sectors;

• Assess the proportion of revenue (or CapEx/OpEx) that is aligned with one (or more) of the Environmental Objectives; and then

• Disclose as best practice that the company/issuer’s activities that are aligned with the Taxonomy DNSH criteria or minimum social safeguards.

• If the eligible activity is not aligned with the Green technical screening criteria, then the activity is assessed against the amber, or transition, technical screening criteria and, if it also does no significant harm to the other four environmental objectives, can be considered to be aligned as an amber, or transition, activity under the Taxonomy.

• Eligible activities which are aligned with either the Green or Amber technical screening criteria. Users are recommended to provide disclosure against DNSH tests and to prepare for DNSH requirements should they be mandatory in the future. In the future, a breach of the DNSH requirements for the remaining four environmental objectives will result in the activity being classified as Ineligible under the Taxonomy.

• Taxonomy-aligned Revenues represents the proportion of the net turnover derived from products or services that are from activities that are aligned with the Green or Amber technical screening criteria for at least one of the six environmental objectives of the Taxonomy.

• Taxonomy-aligned CapEx represents the proportion of the capital expenditure of an activity that is either already Taxonomy-aligned or is part of a credible plan to extend or reach Taxonomy alignment.

• Taxonomy-aligned OpEx represents the proportion of the operating expenditure associated with taxonomy-aligned activities.

After constructing a portfolio of investments, financial institutions would aggregate this information to a portfolio level, using this information to determine (and disclose) how much of a product is aligned with the Taxonomy.

Whilst regulatory activity is not within scope of this Taxonomy, one outcome could be that regulators provide thresholds for alignment, whereby portfolios with a green alignment greater than x% would be permitted to identify as a “green” product, but those with an alignment lower than x% would not.

# What disclosure is recommended from Companies?

The success of the Taxonomy will be enabled by high quality disclosure from issuers, with this ideally aligned with other reporting standards and frameworks, such as the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and GRI, and frameworks, such as TCFD and CDP.

# Reporting and Disclosures

What would disclosure look like?

Financial Institutions would report the degree of alignment of an investment portfolio or financial product with the Taxonomy, on a weighted basis.

## Page 69

S I N G A P O R E - A S I A T A X O N O M Y F O R S U S T A I N A B L E F I N A N C E | 2 0 2 3

This information would be disclosed both in listing documents (for example, prospectus documents) and on an ongoing basis via annual reports or equivalent (including dedicated non-financial or sustainability reports).

Specifically, issuers should disclose the percentage of their business that is aligned with the Taxonomy (by way of revenue, CapEx or OpEx), the specific Environmental Objective/Objectives with which the company is aligned, and the ways in which the issuer has ensured compliance with the minimum safeguards as described in the relevant DNSH section of the Taxonomy.

The issuer should present such information on an activity-by-activity basis, where the issuer is involved in more than one activity.

- Where the issuer is reporting alignment with an activity determined to be amber (transition), there is a particular emphasis on the issuer to describe (both quantitatively and qualitatively) the way that such an activity is aiding in transition.
- The issuer should outline the current alignment of the activity or project with the transition thresholds and the operational plan to transition the activity or project to the Green thresholds, including target date(s) and final Environmental Objectives.
- The issuer could also provide more information about CapEx/OpEx requirements to meet that objective/threshold or feasibility plan of meeting the threshold.

# Ineligible activities

Whilst these disclosures are not currently a regulatory requirement, issuers wishing to attract “green” capital would be motivated to make such disclosures. One additional outcome of the Taxonomy as discussed earlier is that regulators consider incorporating mandatory regulatory disclosures that are aligned with and would facilitate consideration of Taxonomy alignment.

Where an economic activity does not meet the technical screening criteria for Green or Amber, then the activity will, by default, be classed as ineligible as this is neither currently aligned with a low-carbon economy or has a transition pathway to alignment.

Economic activities will be classed as ‘Ineligible’ under the Taxonomy if the economic activity does not fall within the scope of the Taxonomy.

# Taxonomy Reporting Recommendations/Expectations in Practice

At present, the Taxonomy is only considering the first environmental objective, climate change mitigation, with subsequent environmental objectives to follow in future iterations of the Taxonomy. This means promoting activities that are already low carbon or can contribute to a transition to a low-carbon economy. Under this assessment, the recommended reporting elements are as follows:

# Green Activities

Where the issuer is reporting alignment with an activity determined to be Green, the issuer should describe (both quantitatively and qualitatively) how the activity meets the technical screening criteria for climate change mitigation, any external verification or due diligence of these metrics, and the level of associated revenue/turnover.

# Do No Significant Harm

To be classed as aligned, an economic activity has to meet the technical screening criteria for that activity. It is also recommended for all users of the Taxonomy to provide disclosures about how DNSH requirements are met (or not met).

The DNSH assessment is to ensure that, at the same time as an economic activity or project is making a substantial contribution to one of the five Environmental Objectives under the Taxonomy, it is not doing so through practices or policies which would cause potential or actual harm to any of the other four Environmental Objectives.

While compliance with the DNSH tests are not compulsory in the early implementation of the Taxonomy, in the future this may be required so that if there is no identifiable approach or option to mitigate this potential harm, then the activity will be classed as ‘ineligible’ under the Taxonomy.

# DNSH requirements are detailed in its own chapter.

For the purposes of this section, the discussion on DNSH and case studies provided below are to help users of the Taxonomy understand how the DNSH requirements are intended to work.

The DNSH sections of the Classification chapter are designed to help in assisting financiers, highlighting the issues, the principal harm that could possibly come, and the metrics to be monitoring.

# The due diligence process includes:

understanding the risk associated with an activity or project, with reference to the activity or project, and its location, and potential social impact; and assessing the metrics that need to be interrogated.

Note that this DNSH-based due diligence does not end at the point of investment. Investors are expected to continually monitor indicators and engage with issuers to understand the way that materiality, probability and risk management have evolved. Investors should also remain apprised of new and emerging risks to the issuer.

# Minimum Social Safeguards

The Taxonomy establishes certain minimum safeguards that are applicable to all assessments – investors should determine that the issuer is compliant with the OECD Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, with specific reference to the ILO Core Labour Conventions.

# Case Studies

# Case study: Off-shore wind farm, equity financed

Off-shore wind energy is considered to make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation by providing zero-emissions energy and are classified as Green under the Taxonomy. Company A makes 20% of its revenue from off-shore wind farms and 80% of its revenue from thermal coal-fired power stations.

# Case study: Freight transportation, equity financed

Freight transportation currently accounts for a significant proportion of carbon emissions from transportation in Singapore and the wider ASEAN region so reducing tailpipe emissions from this source.

# Case study: Construction of new buildings, debt financed

Construction of energy and resource efficient new buildings can make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation by reducing GHG emissions from the operational and construction.

# Financial institution portfolio reporting:

The electric-powered transportation activity automatically falls under the green classification. The Financial Institution then should take steps to satisfy itself that the company does not breach the DNSH tests on pollution and the circular economy to classify this company’s activity as Green under the Taxonomy.

# Conclusion

It is envisaged that some criteria and methods outlined in this Taxonomy will need periodic revision, while other areas could entail further progression subject to industry development and technology advancement down the road. There could also be changes on the economic activities in and out of scope as transition moves along. The Taxonomy would allow monitoring capital flows towards sustainable finance and facilitate greater growth of green finance in Singapore and the broader ASEAN region.

# Introduction

# 1. Energy sector

The Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) assessment ensures that while the economic activities make substantial contribution to climate change mitigation, they do not cause significant harm to all other environmental objectives of the Taxonomy.

The other environmental objectives of Singapore Taxonomy are as follows:

- Climate change adaptation
- Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity
- Promote resource resilience and circular economy
- Pollution prevention and control

# Do no significant harm assessment

The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from the installation and operation of photovoltaic (PV) panels relate to:

- The PV installation siting: impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity if built in a designated conservation area or other areas with important ecosystem and biodiversity value.
- The impacts from the production and end-of-life management of the PV systems and its component/materials: potentially significant environmental impacts are associated with the sourcing/production of materials and components of PV systems.

The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from CSP is associated with:

- the construction of the installation and the substantial land-take associated with the installation
- impact on birdlife from the high temperatures generated by the plant
- impact of the cooling system on water resources

# 1.2 Wind power generation

# Do no significant harm assessment

In spite of the crucial contribution of wind energy to mitigating climate change, there may be conflicts arising between its deployment and nature conservation at a local level. The main environmental exposures to be considered as a DNSH criteria, in the most stringent sense, include:

- Underwater noise created in the installation of bottom-fixed offshore wind turbines;
- The composite waste generated from both on- and offshore wind turbine blades at the end of their lifetime;
- The possible disturbance, displacement or collision of birds and bats by the construction and operation of wind farms.
- The possible deterioration of water ecosystem associated to the construction of wind farms.
- The possible visual impacts created by landscape change in the installation of wind turbines.

# Objectives

# Criteria

Climate change

- Refer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation: Table 18.
- Also, can refer to ISO Standard for Adaptation to climate change: ISO 14091:2021 — Guidelines on vulnerability, impacts and risk assessment.

Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity

- Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with national and international standards (e.g IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks; Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) Voluntary guidelines on biodiversity-inclusive impact assessment) – including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations.
- Ensure any required mitigation measures for protecting biodiversity/eco-systems have been implemented (i.e.: avoid possible collision of birds and visual impacts, generated by the change in landscape, due to the construction and operation of wind farms).
- For sites/operations located in or near to biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), as well as other protected areas), ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 6) – based on the conservation objectives of the protected area.
- For such sites/operations, ensure that:
- a site-level biodiversity management plan exists and is implemented in alignment with the IFC Performance Standard 6;
- all necessary mitigation measures are in place to reduce the impacts on species and habitats;
- a robust, appropriately designed and long-term biodiversity monitoring and evaluation programme exists and is implemented.

# Pollution prevention and control

- Ensure any required mitigation measures for avoiding underwater noise created by the installation of offshore wind turbines.
- Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level.

# 1.3 Hydropower generation

# Do no significant harm assessment

- State ambition to maximise recycling at end of life based on waste management plans, dismantling/decommissioning processes at time of decommissioning (e.g. through contractual agreements with recycling partners, reflection in financial projections or official project documentation), aligned to international standards and guidelines (ex: KAPSARC Guide to circular economy, French standard, XP X30-901, Circular economy – Circular economy project management system).

Ensure that the following conditions are met based on ground evidence:

- All practical steps are taken to mitigate the impacts.
- The project has been recognised of overriding public interest and/or it is proven that the benefits of the project outweigh its impacts.
- There are no significantly environmentally better option.
- The project does not show significant adverse impact on upstream or downstream water bodies.
- This applies to newly built hydropower and extension of existing hydropower.

Construction of new hydropower should not lead to increase fragmentation of rivers, consequently refurbishment of existing hydropower plant and rehabilitation of existing barriers should be prioritised. Construction of small hydropower (&#x3C;10MW) should be avoided.

During operation:

- All necessary mitigation measures should be implemented to reach good ecological status or potential, in particular regarding ecological continuity and ecological flow. Priority should be given to nature-based solutions.
- Aligned to IFC’s and World Bank Group’s environmental and social standards.

General impact: Operation of the hydropower plant must adhere to the principles of the UNECE Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary, Watercourses and International Lakes.

# 1.4. Geothermal energy generation (including electricity, heat, cool)

# Do no significant harm assessment

The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from production of electric energy from high-enthalpy geothermal system is associated with:

- Non-condensable geothermal gases with specific environmental threats, such as H2S, CO2, and CH4, are often released from flash-steam and dry-steam power plants. Binary plants ideally represent closed systems, and no steam is emitted.
- Possible emissions to surface and underground water.

| Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity      | - Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with national and international standards (e.g IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks; Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) Voluntary guidelines on biodiversity-inclusive impact assessment) – including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations.

- Ensure any required mitigation measures for protecting biodiversity/eco-systems have been implemented (i.e. avoid fragmentation of ecosystems and hydrological and hydrogeological regimes, affecting species migration pathways).

- For sites/operations located in or near to biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), as well as other protected areas), ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 6) – based on the conservation objectives of the protected area.

- For such sites/operations, ensure that:

* a site-level biodiversity management plan exists and is implemented in alignment with the IFC Performance Standard 6;
* all necessary mitigation measures are in place to reduce the impacts on species and habitats;
* a robust, appropriately designed and long-term biodiversity monitoring and evaluation programme exists and is implemented. |

The key environmental aspects to be taken into account when investing in this activity are the impact on local water (consumption and sewage), the fulfilment of the applicable waste and recycling criteria, the SO2, NOx dust and other emissions control and the avoidance of direct impacts on sensitive ecosystems, species or habitats.

Intelligent pathways for cascading use are environmentally superior and preferable to single use.

# Do no significant harm assessment

The impacts of transmission and distribution lines are a function of the spatial alignment of the grid, the structures and conductors required for various voltages, the extent to which pre-existing corridors are used, and how the transmission and distribution lines are operated and maintained. The most common environmental impacts of electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure are visual, ecosystem and land use. In the cases of underground offshore electricity lines, water and marine resources may be impacted.

# Pollution prevention and control

Underground power lines: Avoid routings with heavy impact on marine and terrestrial ecosystems and follow the principles of IFC General EHS Guidelines for construction site activities.

Overground high voltage lines:

- For construction site activities follow the principles of IFC General EHS Guideline.
- Respect applicable norms and regulations to limit impact of electromagnetic radiation on human health. (ex: 1998 ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection))
- Do not use PCBs Polychlorinated Biphenyls.

# Promote resource resilience and circular economy

State ambition to maximise recycling at end of life based on waste management plans, dismantling/decommissioning processes at time of decommissioning (e.g. through contractual agreements with recycling partners, reflection in financial projections or official project documentation), aligned to international standards and guidelines (ex: KAPSARC Guide to circular economy, French standard, XP X30-901, Circular economy – Circular economy project management system).

# Do no significant harm assessment

The energy storage activities differ considerably in their physical, chemical and biological bases and forms, which result in divergent environmental impacts in each case.

The key environmental aspects to be taken into account when investing in this activity are the impact on local water (consumption and sewage), the fulfilment of the applicable waste and recycling criteria, the NOx and CO emissions control and the avoidance of direct impacts on sensitive ecosystems, species or habitats.

# 1.12. District heating and cooling systems

# Do no significant harm assessment

The key environmental aspects to be taken into account when investing in this activity are the impact on local water (consumption and sewage), the fulfilment of the applicable waste and recycling criteria, the NOx and CO emissions control and the avoidance of direct impacts on sensitive ecosystems, species or habitats.

# Do no significant harm assessment

Key environmental aspects to be considered for the investments in Distribution of District Level Heating and Cooling are summarised as follows:

- For the construction of the mains, the potential significant harms to the environmental objectives are constituted by the typical potential harms connected to construction of facilities in general. This includes inter alia, terrestrial habitat alteration, loss of valuable ecosystem, land consumption, overburden disposal, negative effects on biodiversity, emissions of particles and NOx, noise and hazardous materials.
- For the operation of the district heating networks, potential significant impacts are considered low. They relate mainly to the potential impact of underground district heating networks on drinking water/ground water systems and local ecosystems through corrosion products from corrosion of the distribution system elements and applied water additives that may be non-biodegradable.

| Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity      | - Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with national and international standards (e.g IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks; Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) Voluntary guidelines on biodiversity-inclusive impact assessment) – including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations.

- Ensure any required mitigation measures for protecting biodiversity/eco-systems have been implemented.

- For sites/operations located in or near to biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), as well as other protected areas), ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 6) – based on the conservation objectives of the protected area.

- For such sites/operations, ensure that:

* a site-level biodiversity management plan exists and is implemented in alignment with the IFC Performance Standard 6;
* all necessary mitigation measures are in place to reduce the impacts on species and habitats;
* a robust, appropriately designed and long-term biodiversity monitoring and evaluation programme exists and is implemented. |

# 2. Transport

# 2.1. Transport via railways

# Do no significant harm assessment

Key environmental aspects to be considered for investments on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles are the following:

# Do no significant harm assessment

- Direct emissions to air from the exhaust gases of internal combustion engine: nitrogen oxides (NOx), total hydrocarbon (THC), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM) and particle number, and from tyre abrasion and brakes friction and noise emissions.
- The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from the operation of rail transport activities are attributed to air pollution, noise and vibration, water use. Direct emissions of air pollutants are not an issue of concern in the case of electrified rail, but only where (very efficient) diesel or hybrid engines would meet the CO2e-threshold defined to ensure substantial mitigation of GHG emissions.
- Indirect emissions to air from the production of fuels and energy carriers. However, this is out of the control of vehicles manufacturers and operators.
- Waste generation (hazardous and non-hazardous) during maintenance and end-of-life of the vehicle.
- Recycling of materials in order to reduce consumption of critical raw materials and impact on ecosystems and natural capital.

# Promote resource resilience and circular economy

Ensure proper waste management both at the use phase (maintenance) and the end-of-life for the rolling stock, e.g. reuse and recycle of parts like batteries, in compliance with international and national legislation on hazardous waste generation, management and treatment. (ex: KAPSARC Guide to circular economy, French standard, XP X30-901, Circular economy – Circular economy project management system).

Measures are in place to manage waste in accordance with the waste hierarchy, in particular during maintenance.

# Promote resource resilience and circular economy

Compliance with international and national legislation on hazardous waste generation, management and treatment. Special focus on critical raw materials recovery from batteries.

- For both Maintenance and end-of-life management of vehicles or rolling stock, ensure compliance with international and national legislation on hazardous waste generation, management and treatment (ex: ISO 14001:2015 Environmental management systems; ISO 22628:2002 Road vehicles — Recyclability and recoverability; Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (1989): Basel Action Network Standard for Responsible Recycling and Reuse of Electronic Equipment, known as e-Stewards). Measures are in place to manage waste both in the use phase (maintenance) and the end-of-life of the fleet, including through reuse and recycling of batteries and electronics (in particular critical raw materials therein), in accordance with the waste hierarchy.

# 2.5. Transport infrastructure

# Do no significant harm assessment

The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from infrastructure activities are attributed to noise and vibration pollution, water contamination, waste generation and impacts on biodiversity (habitat and wildlife) and land use consumption with ecosystem impacts specifically:

- Contamination of water during construction and unsustainable use of water during construction and operations
- Unsustainable use of resources during constructions, e.g. generation of high amount of waste, no recycling/reuse of construction waste
- Noise pollution can be relevant for both rolling stock and railway infrastructure as noise can be generated by both rolling stock and poor conditions of rail tracks.
- Construction of infrastructure can cause significant harm when taking place in protected areas or areas of high biodiversity values outside protected areas.
- Infrastructure can cause fragmentation and degradation of the natural and urban landscape due to the “barrier” effects of the infrastructure and can involve risks of wildlife accidents caused by collisions. Railway infrastructure (in particular tunnels) can cause change and degradation of hydromorphological conditions of water bodies and therefore have impacts on aquatic ecosystems.

| Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity      | - Infrastructure for low carbon transport is land use intensive and is a major factor of ecosystem deterioration and biodiversity loss. Projects should ensure that:
- Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with national and international standards (e.g IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks; Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) Voluntary guidelines on biodiversity-inclusive impact assessment).
- Such impact assessments should, at the very least, identify, evaluate, and mitigate any potential negative impacts of the designated activities, projects, or assets on ecosystems and its biodiversity.
- Invasive plants are appearing very often along transport infrastructure and are sometimes even spread due to transport infrastructure, which might negatively impact natural ecosystems (e.g. natural fauna). Care should be taken not to spread any invasive plants through proper maintenance.
- Wildlife collisions is a problem and should be considered. Solutions developed for should be applied for the detection and avoidance of potential traps that may cause the unnecessary death of animals.
- Mitigation options exist and different types of measures can be beneficial for wildlife, such as:
* Wildlife warning systems combined with heat sensors can reduce the number of collisions.
* Fences along areas with high strike risk.
* Viaducts, tunnels, overpasses and bridges, etc.
* Warning signals that are triggered by approaching traffic, particularly in areas of high strike risk. |
| Pollution prevention and control                 | * Minimise noise and vibrations from use of infrastructure by introducing open trenches/wall barriers/other measures and comply with national and international standards. (Ex: ISO/TS 21929-2, Sustainability in building construction – Sustainability indicators – Part 2: Framework for the development of indicators for civil engineering works).
* Minimise noise, dust, emissions pollution during construction/maintenance works.
* Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Promote resource resilience and circular economy | - Re-use parts and use recycled material during the renewal, upgrade and construction of infrastructure.
- At least 80% (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and demolition waste (excluding naturally occurring material) generated on the construction site must be prepared for re-use, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling operations using waste to substitute other materials.
- Activities aligned with international standards. Ex: ISO 20887:2020 – Sustainability in buildings and civil engineering works.
- Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented as per international standards and guidelines. (ex: UNEP International Water Quality Guidelines for Ecosystems (IWQGES); ISO 13.060: Water Quality).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

# 2.6. Sea and coastal water transport

# Do no significant harm assessment

The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from the operation of sea and coastal water transport are summarised as follows:

- Direct emissions to air of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM), as well as noise emissions
- Waste generation (hazardous and non-hazardous) during maintenance and end-of-life of the vessel.
- Direct and indirect emission of pollutants in water.

- the use of water in water stressed areas for cooling purposes; and
- the generation of wastes.

Disodium Carbonate (soda ash):
- - the generation of process effluents (e.g. calcium chloride in aqueous solution), by products and wastes with the potential to pollute groundwater and surface water bodies as well as soils;
- polluting air emissions;
- the use of water in water scarce areas for cooling purposes; and
- impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity from the disposal of wastes and by-products (primarily calcium carbonate, gypsum, sodium chloride and calcium chloride, although there can be trace amounts of toxic materials such as mercury, cadmium, arsenic and zinc depending on the source of the raw materials (e.g. limestone) for the production process) which create ‘waste beds’.

# Pollution prevention and control

• Ensure emissions to air, water and soil are prevented / minimised as per international standards and guidelines for the Production of Cement, Lime and Magnesium Oxide. (Ex: IFC EHS Guidelines: Air emissions and ambient air quality; ISO 14001:2015 Environmental management systems — Requirements with guidance for use; Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM); ISO 11014:2009(en) Safety data sheet for chemical products).

• Ensure implementation of a recognised environmental management system (ISO 14001, EMAS, or equivalent).

• Exclusion of refuse derived fuels for cement production. Co-incineration of waste has significant impacts on health and the environment due to the polluting nature of the associated emissions, and higher emissions ceiling for cement plants in comparison with dedicated waste incineration plants. Furthermore, promoting waste as eligible fuel source may undermine waste minimisation efforts in other sectors.

• Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level.

# Promote resource resilience and circular economy

Cement manufacturing plants accept alternative fuels such as SRF originating from waste, as well as secondary raw materials such as recycled concrete aggregates (RCA).

# 4.4. Manufacture of hydrogen

# Do no significant harm assessment

The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from manufacture of hydrogen is, in practical terms, inseparable from the potential for significant harm created by the hydrocarbon refining activity more generally and is associated with:

- polluting emissions to air (in the case of hydrogen production via electrolysis, there is an indirect environmental impact associated with the generation of electricity);
- water used for cooling might lead to local resource depletion, dependent of the local scarcity of water resources; and
- the generation of wastes (e.g. spent catalysts and by-products of the various physical and chemical treatment processes used in purifying the hydrogen produced via hydrocarbon processing).

# 4.5. Manufacture of aluminium

# Do no significant harm assessment

The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from manufacture of aluminium is associated with:

- the potential for significant air emission impacts: perfluorocarbons, fluoride gases, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and particulate matter (e.g. unused cryolite). Hydrogen fluorides can be toxic to vegetation;
- the toxic, corrosive and reactive nature of waste generated by the used linings (cathodes) from the electrolytic cells (known as spent pot lining (SPL)). Dissolved fluorides and cyanides from the SPL material can create significant environmental impacts including groundwater contamination and pollution of local watercourses;
- the ability (or lacking thereof) of aluminium manufacturing plants to incorporate aluminium scrap (including scrap from their own manufacturing processes) in the production process; and the potential to impact ecosystems as a result of the land footprint of the site and from polluting emissions.

- A minimum requirement is the implementation and adherence to a recognised environmental management system (ISO 14001, EMAS, or equivalent).
- Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level.

# Promote resource resilience and circular economy

- Where manufacture of hydrogen takes place within the context of an oil and gas refining installation, ensure appropriate measures are in place to minimise and manage waste and material use in accordance with international standards and guidelines for the Refining of Mineral Oil and Gas (ex: KAPSARC Guide to circular economy, French standard, XP X30-901, Circular economy – Circular economy project management system; ISO/TC 323 (In development Scenario 2); ISO/AWI 59014: Secondary materials — Principles, sustainability and traceability requirements; Global Recycled Standard (GRS): is a voluntary product standard for tracking and verifying the content of recycled materials in a final product.; ETP Clean Energy Technology Guide).
- Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented as per international standards and guidelines (ex: UNEP International Water Quality Guidelines for Ecosystems (IWQGES); ISO 13.060: Water Quality).
- In order to avoid risks to circular economy, aluminium manufacturing plants need to be able to process aluminium scrap. In order to avoid unnecessary resource and energy consumption, the aluminium scrap collection and sorting activities should be optimised for separation on an alloy specific basis. If scrap alloys are mixed, the functionality of the recycled material is restricted, and valuable alloying elements may be lost.

# 4.10. Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transport

# 4.11. Manufacture of energy efficiency equipment for buildings

# Do no significant harm assessment

The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from the manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transport is associated with:

- the (potential) use of toxic substances and generation of toxic wastes (both at the manufacturing stage as well as at other stages of the product/equipment lifecycle); and
- the potential for polluting emissions to air, water and soil from the manufacturing process.

Depending on the product/equipment being manufactured, there may, also be issues with respect to the embodied carbon and the demand for certain metals and materials (e.g. rare earth metals) which are in limited supply and may have significant environmental impact issues associated with the mining phase.

# Do no significant harm assessment

Key environmental aspects span across all other five objectives and are summarised as follows:

- ability of forests to adapt to a changing climate;
- impact on water resources as well as on water quality;
- pollution to water, air, and soil, and risks associated from the use of pesticides and fertiliser;
- impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems from intensification and conversion of land of high ecological value to forests and illegal logging.

# 5.2. Forestry plantation

# Do no significant harm assessment

Key environmental aspects span across all other five objectives and are summarised as follows:

- ability of forests to adapt to a changing climate;
- impact on water resources as well as on water quality;
- pollution to water, air, and soil, and risks associated from the use of pesticides and fertiliser;
- impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems from intensification and conversion of land of high ecological value to forests and illegal logging.

Note that areas of environmental risk are highly geographically variable. Guidance should be sought from the relevant competent national or regional authority to identify areas or issues of importance and relevance within the area or project concerned.

| Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity      | - Take measures to ensure sustained or improved long term conservation status at the landscape level.
- In designated conservation areas, actions should be demonstrated to be in line with the conservation objectives for those areas.
- No conversion of habitats specifically sensitive to biodiversity loss or of high conservation value such as grasslands and any high carbon stock area (e.g. peat lands and wetlands), and areas set aside for the restoration of such habitats in line with national legislation.
- Develop a forest management plan (or equivalent) that includes provisions for maintaining biodiversity.
- Evaluate the ecosystem service provision with the aim to not decrease the amount and quality of ecosystem services provided.
- Forests are monitored and protected to prevent illegal logging, in compliance with national laws.
- Promote close-to-nature forestry or similar concepts depending on the local requirements and limitations.
- Select native species or species, varieties, ecotypes and provenance of trees that adequately provide the necessary resilience to climate change, natural disasters and the biotic, pedologic and hydrologic condition of the area concerned, as well as the potential invasive character of the species under local conditions, current and projected climate change.
- Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with national and international standards (e.g IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks; Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) Voluntary guidelines on biodiversity-inclusive impact assessment)) – including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations. |
| Pollution prevention and control                 | * Minimise the use of pesticides and favour alternative approaches or techniques, such as non-chemical alternatives to pesticides. With exception of occasions that this is needed to control pest and diseases outbreaks. Adapt the use of fertilisers to what is needed to prevent leeching of nutrients to waters.
* Take well documented and verifiable measures to avoid the use of active ingredients that are listed in the Stockholm Convention, the Rotterdam Convention, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, or that are listed as classification Ia or Ib in the WHO recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard;
* Prevent pollution of water and soil in the forest concerned and undertake clean up measures when it does happen.
* Ensure emissions to air, water and soil are prevented / minimised as per international and national standards Ex: IFC EHS Guidelines: Air emissions and ambient air quality; ISO 14001:2015; Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM); ISO 11014:2009(en) Safety data sheet for chemical products; ISO/TC 134, Fertilisers and soil conditioners; ISO 27065, Protective clothing – Performance requirements for protective clothing worn by operators applying liquid pesticides; FAO's The International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management; Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade, the Minamata Convention on Mercury, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, and of active ingredients).
* Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level.                                     |
| Promote resource resilience and circular economy | - Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented as per international standards and guidelines. (ex: UNEP International Water Quality Guidelines for Ecosystems (IWQGES); ISO 13.060: Water Quality).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

- pollution to water, air, and soil, and risks associated from the use of pesticides and fertiliser;
- impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems from intensification and conversion of land of high ecological value to forests and illegal logging.

Note that areas of environmental risk are highly geographically variable. Guidance should be sought from the relevant competent national or regional authority to identify areas or issues of importance and relevance within the area or project concerned.

| Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity      | - Take measures to ensure sustained or improved long term conservation status at the landscape level.

- In designated conservation areas, actions should be demonstrated to be in line with the conservation objectives for those areas.

- No conversion of habitats specifically sensitive to biodiversity loss or of high conservation value such as grasslands and any high carbon stock area (e.g. peat lands and wetlands), and areas set aside for the restoration of such habitats in line with national legislation.

- Develop a forest management plan (or equivalent) that includes provisions for maintaining biodiversity.

- Evaluate the ecosystem service provision with the aim to not decrease the amount and quality of ecosystem services provided.

- Forests are monitored and protected to prevent illegal logging, in compliance with national laws.

- Promote close-to-nature forestry or similar concepts depending on the local requirements and limitations.

- Select native species or species, varieties, ecotypes and provenance of trees that adequately provide the necessary resilience to climate change, natural disasters and the biotic, pedologic and hydrologic condition of the area concerned, as well as the potential invasive character of the species under local conditions, current and projected climate change.

- Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with national and international standards (e.g IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks; Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) Voluntary guidelines on biodiversity-inclusive impact assessment) – including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations.

- For sites/operations located in or near to biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), as well as other protected areas), ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 6) – based on the conservation objectives of the protected area.

- For such sites/operations, ensure that:

* a site-level biodiversity management plan exists and is implemented in alignment with the IFC Performance Standard 6;
* all necessary mitigation measures are in place to reduce the impacts on species and habitats;
* a robust, appropriately designed and long-term biodiversity monitoring and evaluation programme exists and is implemented. |
| Pollution prevention and control                 | * Minimise the use of pesticides and favour alternative approaches or techniques, such as non-chemical alternatives to pesticides. With exception of occasions that this is needed to control pest and diseases outbreaks. Adapt the use of fertilisers to what is needed to prevent leeching of nutrients to waters.
* Take well documented and verifiable measures to avoid the use of active ingredients that are listed in the Stockholm Convention, the Rotterdam Convention, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, or that are listed as classification Ia or Ib in the WHO recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard.
* Prevent pollution of water and soil in the forest concerned and undertake clean up measures when it does happen.
* Ensure emissions to air, water and soil are prevented / minimised as per international and national standards Ex: IFC EHS Guidelines: Air emissions and ambient air quality; ISO 14001:2015; Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM); ISO 11014:2009(en) Safety data sheet for chemical products; ISO/TC 134, Fertilisers and soil conditioners; ISO 27065, Protective clothing – Performance requirements for protective clothing worn by operators applying liquid pesticides; FAO's The International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management; Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade, the Minamata Convention on Mercury, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, and of active ingredients.

# 6.2. Captured CO2 Transportation

# 6.3. Permanent sequestration of captured CO2

# Do no significant harm assessment

The main environmental impacts associated with Capture of Anthropogenic Emissions are due to chemicals/technologies used to capture carbon.

# Do no significant harm assessment

The main environmental impacts associated with sequestration of CO2 are due to:

- the risk of leakage
- the long-term lack of geological containment of the reservoirs, central issues regarding the monitoring and the interrelation of carbon with physical, chemical and geological conditions in the reservoir is still a debated argument, however the safety of CO2 storage may be assured with the implementation of specific rules and requirements

# Objectives

# Criteria

Climate change adaptation

# Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity

- Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with national and international standards (e.g IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks; Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) Voluntary guidelines on biodiversity-inclusive impact assessment) – including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations.
- Ensure any required mitigation measures for protecting biodiversity/eco-systems have been implemented (i.e. avoid possible collision of birds and visual impacts, generated by the change in landscape, due to the construction and operation of wind farms)
- For sites/operations located in or near to biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), as well as other protected areas), ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 6) – based on the conservation objectives of the protected area.
- For such sites/operations, ensure that:
- a site-level biodiversity management plan exists and is implemented in alignment with the IFC Performance Standard 6;
- all necessary mitigation measures are in place to reduce the impacts on species and habitats;
- a robust, appropriately designed and long-term biodiversity monitoring and evaluation programme exists and is implemented.

# Pollution prevention and control

A minimum requirement is the implementation and adherence to a recognised environmental management system (ISO 14001, EMAS, or equivalent).

Follow all the requirements of national and international standards to ensure emissions to air, water and soil are prevented/minimised and in particular:

- Prevent release during operation by implementing permanent leakage detection systems.
- Avoid loss of ammonia.
- Minimise the formation of secondary aerosol and the production of tropospheric ozone.

Fans, compressors, pumps and other equipment, must comply, where relevant, with the top class requirements of the energy label, and represent the best available technology.

Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level.

# Promote resource resilience and circular economy

Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented as per international standards and guidelines. (ex: UNEP International Water Quality Guidelines for Ecosystems (IWQGES); ISO 13.060: Water Quality).

# Promote resource resilience and circular economy

• The production of servers, storage devices and network technology also consumes a great deal of energy and thus emits CO2. The equipment used should meet the requirements of the national and international standards for servers and data storage products.

• When electrical and electronic equipment reaches its end of service, the waste electrical and electronic equipment is collected and managed by an authorised operator and treated according to the waste hierarchy.

• Implement measures concerning waste management to minimise and manage waste and material use, especially hazardous manufacturing waste as per international standards and guidelines.

# 8. Waste

# 8.1. Collection and transport of non-hazardous waste

Do no significant harm assessment

The main potential significant harm linked to this activity is related to:

- emissions of collection vehicles that cause harm to human health and the environment
- mixing source segregated waste fractions that could impair subsequent material recovery and recycling.

Compliance with relevant international and respective national law as well as consistency with national, regional or local water management strategies and plans is a minimum requirement.

Climate change

- Refer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation: Table 18.
- Also, can refer to ISO Standard for Adaptation to climate change: ISO 14091:2021 — Guidelines on vulnerability, impacts and risk assessment.

Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity

- Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with national and international standards (e.g IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks; Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD).

Pollution prevention and control

- AD plant emissions to air and water are within national and international guidelines (ex: IFC EHS Guidelines: Air emissions and ambient air quality; ISO 14001:2015 Environmental management systems — Requirements with guidance for use; Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM); ISO 11014:2009(en) Safety data sheet for chemical products).
- Emissions to air (e.g. SOx, NOx) after combustion of biogas are controlled, abated (when needed) and within the limits set by national legislation.
- The resulting digestate meets the requirements for fertilising materials as per national rules on fertilisers/soil improvers for agriculture use.

Promote resource resilience and circular economy

- For sites/operations located in or near to biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), as well as other protected areas), ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 6) – based on the conservation objectives of the protected area.
- For such sites/operations, ensure that:

# Pollution prevention and control

- Ensure emissions to air, water and soil are prevented/minimized as per international standards and guidelines. (Ex: IFC EHS Guidelines: Air emissions and ambient air quality; ISO 14001:2015 Environmental management systems — Requirements with guidance for use; Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM); ISO 11014:2009(en) Safety data sheet for chemical products).
- Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level.

# Promote resource resilience and circular economy

- Avoid mixing different source segregated waste fractions in waste storage and transfer facilities.
- Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented as per international standards and guidelines. (ex: UNEP International Water Quality Guidelines for Ecosystems (IWQGES); ISO 13.060: Water Quality).

# Climate change adaptation

- Refer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation: Table 18.
- Also, can refer to national standards or ISO Standard for Adaptation to climate change: ISO 14091:2021 — Guidelines on vulnerability, impacts and risk assessment.

# Protect healthy ecosystems and biodiversity

- Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with national or international standards (e.g IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks; Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) Voluntary guidelines on biodiversity-inclusive impact assessment) – including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations.
- Ensure any required mitigation measures for protecting biodiversity/eco-systems have been implemented, in accordance to national standards.
- For sites/operations located in or near to biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), as well as other protected areas), ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with national or international standards (e.g. IFC Performance Standard 6) – based on the conservation objectives of the protected area.
- For such sites/operations, ensure that:
- a site-level biodiversity management plan exists and is implemented in alignment with the IFC Performance Standard 6;
- all necessary mitigation measures are in place to reduce the impacts on species and habitats;
- a robust, appropriately designed and long-term biodiversity monitoring and evaluation programme exists and is implemented.

# Pollution prevention and control

Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level, in accordance to national standards.

# Promote resource resilience and circular economy

Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented as per national or international standards and guidelines. (ex: UNEP International Water Quality Guidelines for Ecosystems (IWQGES); ISO 13.060: Water Quality).

Do no significant harm assessment

Promote resource resilience and circular economy

- Activities should minimise raw material use per unit of output, including energy through increased resource use efficiency.
- Activities should minimise the loss of nutrients (in particular nitrogen and phosphate) leaching out from the production system into the environment.
- Activities should use residues and by-products from the production or harvesting of crops to reduce demand for primary resources, in line with good agricultural practice.
- Implement measures concerning waste management to minimise and manage waste and material use, especially hazardous manufacturing waste as per international standards and guidelines (ex: KAPSARC Guide to circular economy, French standard, XP X30-901, Circular economy – Circular economy project management system; ISO/TC 323 (In development Scenario 2); ISO/AWI 59014: Secondary materials — Principles, sustainability and traceability requirements; Global Recycled Standard (GRS); Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM); ISO 11014:2009(en) Safety data sheet for chemical products).

Note that areas of environmental risk are highly geographically variable. Guidance should be sought from the relevant competent national or regional authority to identify areas or issues of importance and relevance within the area or project concerned.

Ensure that water use/conservation management plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, have been developed and implemented as per international standards and guidelines (ex: UNEP International Water Quality Guidelines for Ecosystems (IWQGES); ISO 13.060: Water Quality).

The activity livestock production captures a distinct set of sub-activities that would include intensive and extensive forms of livestock rearing, as well as the management of permanent grassland. These come with different key environmental aspects that need to be considered for investments in this sector, summarised as follows:

- ability of farming systems to adapt to a changing climate;
- impact on water quantity, water quality and water ecosystems incl. waste water treatment from intensive rearing;
- manure treatment;
- Emissions of pollutants (such as methane, ammonia, dust, odour, noise) to air, water and soil, in particular in the case of intensive rearing;
- impact on habitats and species.

Note that areas of environmental risk are highly geographically variable. Guidance should be sought from the relevant competent national or regional authority to identify areas or issues of importance and relevance within the area or project concerned (ex: UNEP International Water Quality Guidelines for Ecosystems (IWQGES); ISO 13.060: Water Quality).

- Activities do not lead to the conversion, fragmentation or unsustainable intensification of high-nature-value land, wetlands, forests, or other areas of high-biodiversity value. This includes highly biodiverse grassland spanning more than one hectare that is:
- - v) natural, namely grassland that would remain grassland in the absence of human intervention and that maintains the natural species composition and ecological characteristics and processes; or
- vi) non-natural, namely grassland that would cease to be grassland in the absence of human intervention and that is species-rich and not degraded and has been identified as being highly biodiverse by the relevant competent authority.

Activities should not
- - result in a decrease in the diversity or abundance of species and habitats of conservation importance or concern;
- contravene existing management plans or conservation objectives.
- lead to overgrazing or other forms of degradation of grasslands.

Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed in accordance with national and international standards (e.g IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks; Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) Voluntary guidelines on biodiversity-inclusive impact assessment)) – including ancillary services, e.g. transport infrastructure and operations).

# Pollution prevention and control

- Activities ensure that nutrients (fertilisers) and plant protection products (e.g. pesticides and herbicides) are targeted in their application (in time and area treated) and are delivered at appropriate levels (with preference to sustainable biological, physical or other non-chemical methods if possible) and with appropriate equipment and techniques to reduce risk and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment (e.g. water and air pollution) and the loss of excess nutrients through leaching, volatilisation or oxidisation.
- The use only of plant protection products with active substances that ensure high protection of human and animal health and the environment.
- Ensure emissions to air, water and soil are prevented/minimised as per international and national standards Ex: IFC EHS Guidelines: Air emissions and ambient air quality; ISO 14001:2015; Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM); ISO 11014:2009(en) Safety data sheet for chemical products; ISO/TC 134, Fertilisers and soil conditioners; ISO 27065, Protective clothing – Performance requirements for protective clothing worn by operators applying liquid pesticides; FAO's The International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management; Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade, the Minamata Convention on Mercury, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, and of active ingredients).
- Ensure that mitigation and emission reduction techniques for feeding and housing of livestock and for manure storage and processing are applied, as recommended in the UNECE Framework Code for Good Agricultural Practice for Reducing Ammonia;
- Where manure is applied to the land, activities should comply with the limit of 170kg nitrogen application per hectare per year, or alternatively, the derogated threshold as per national standards.
- Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or water consumption at the appropriate level.

# Carbon modelling in the context of Taxonomies

Multiple approaches and methodologies exist for carbon modelling. Choosing an appropriate approach generally rests on the use case and the available data to create a robust model. For the purposes of defining products and taxonomies, we require a method that will allow different technologies to be objectively compared.

## Page 127

Appendix H
# Sectoral Decarbonisation Approach (SDA)

As a basis for initial planning, we recommend the use of the IEA RTS, IEA 2DS and IPCC SR1.5-aligned models at the global scale for their robustness and the accessibility of their data. These global scenarios may be updated for future planning and refinement when more data becomes available to policymakers.

# Business-As-Usual (BAU) and Mitigation Scenarios

We recommend use of the SDA, a widely adopted methodology used by the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) and the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). The degree of intervention is the difference between projected BAU trajectory and carbon mitigation scenarios. Here, we choose a takeoff point of 2019 as the latest year of audited statistical data.

# Input specific to Singapore

In applying the SDA, we must localise the models with Singapore-specific and sector-specific data input. To this purpose, we draw on the public-access and credible datasets at the highest resolution available.

# Data Hierarchy

Government-sourced datasets (i.e. from the Department of Statistics, contributing agencies and publications on national strategy) are preferred over data collated by NGOs or thinktanks. Time series data is preferred over single-year snapshot data quoted in documents. Where able, we have also cross-compared data presented in different publications (e.g. energy and emissions from Singapore’s National Communications and associated reporting to the UNFCCC) to ensure robustness.

For forward projections on economic and sector activity, at the macro-level we use GDP projections in line with government planning norms. Where this is not available (such as for the 2030–2050 window), we take reference from regional growth projections consistent with global scenarios. Sector-specific projections are discussed in the following sections.

# Electricity generation sector

Activity. This is expressed in terms of megawatt-hours (MWh) generated. The strong positive correlation between GDP (as a proxy for economic activity) and electricity demand is well-documented across world economies, and also holds true for Singapore. Although energy efficiency measures have decreased the slope of consumption relative to activity, the correlation coefficient is approx. 0.99. We may therefore model future electricity consumption for Singapore based on GDP projection estimates up to 2050.

Emissions Intensity. The carbon intensity of Singapore’s electricity generation is directly related to its fuel mix for energy generation, which is currently dominated by the use of natural gas. Historically, since liberalisation of the energy market in the late 1990s, natural gas has grown in usage driven purely by market forces and has equilibrated to account for ~80-90% of electricity generation. This has been incorporated into models.

Downstream implications. Electricity is a source of secondary emissions in the Buildings and Transport sectors, and the emissions intensity from has been held consistent in these end-use sectors.

While there may be a large array of scenarios tabled by agencies, thinktanks and academia, they are fundamentally premised on suites of models that encompass economic activity, energy usage, greenhouse gas emissions and climate effects. They are not meant to be used as hard predictions/forecasts, but as guide rails for possible outcomes shaped by policy, economic and technological changes in the decades ahead.

94The SDA method was developed by a partnership comprising CDP, WRI &#x26; WWF under the Science Based Targets initiative, with technical support from Ecofys. 95Energy-Emissions models and Integrated Assessment Models.

# 3 User guidance for Amber measures

# 2 Overview of hard-to-abate sectors — decarbonisation pathways

The Taxonomy proposes different criteria for use of proceeds (Amber measures) and for revenue (Amber activities). These are potentially eligible for Amber category within sustainable finance (noting that some international investors may choose not to invest in Amber) for a sustainable bond.

However, revenues generated from the activity will not be eligible as Amber activities under any disclosure guidelines/requirements until they meet the Amber thresholds.

This will work as follows:

# Does activity meet activity threshold for Green / Amber?

| Yes                                                | No                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Classify associated with revenues as Green / Amber | Revenues are ineligible as Green / Amber. Can be reassessed each year for compliance |

| Other basic chemicals          | The determination of the carbon emission thresholds in these criteria was done based on the alignment to a 1.5°C decarbonisation pathway for the entire chemical sector recently published by Teske et al. (2022). With the reduction rates from Teske et al.’s pathway and taking as basis the thresholds for 2022, the thresholds were extrapolated to 2019 first using the 4.7% annual reduction to have the 2019 base value, afterwards, the aforementioned reduction rates were applied to calculate the 2030, 2040 and 2050 thresholds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Manufacture of cement          | The SBTi Cement sector guidance was chosen as the most suitable for cement company pathways. It is 1.5°C-aligned, being based on a Sectoral Decarbonisation Approach (SDA) reflecting robust IEA modelling of sector-specific carbon budgets, taking into consideration the cost of decarbonising each sector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Manufacture of hydrogen        | There are numerous end-to-end hydrogen production pathways, however they are tailored to energy source, conversion technology, transport method selected. Thus, is preferable to develop pathway-agnostic carbon emissions benchmarks. Climate Bonds has presented the projection of decreasing threshold values performed to ensure that assets and activities are aligned to a transition pathway that contributes to the 1.5°C target. These benchmarks have 2030, 2040 and 2050 targets that get stricter over time to offer guidance to investors and industry on how emissions should reduce in upcoming decades. Hydrogen-production carbon intensity benchmarks can be met by different energy sources and technology options, as has been verified using carbon intensity values estimated by MIT Energy Initiative’s SESAME platform. |

# Cement: Additional methodology and tables

The facility is eligible if its emissions intensity, adjusted using the relevant correction factor (Table 22), is lower than the relevant facility-level emissions intensity threshold (Table 21).

# Worked example 1 – One single cement grade produced on site

A single facility produces cement of strength class 32.5 (correction factor of 1.18 per Table 22).

The facility’s emissions intensity is 0.416tCO2/t cementitious product.

The corrected emissions intensity is 0.491tCO2/t cementitious product (0.416 × 1.18). This is the number compared to the pathway thresholds.

# Worked example 2 – Multiple cement grades produced on site

A single facility produces several cement products of varying strength grades. In an example year, it produces 4,000 tonnes of 42.5 cement, and 6,000 tonnes of 52.5 cement.

The weighted average grade is: ((42.5 × 4,000) + (52.5 × 6,000)) / (4,000 + 10,000) = 48.5

48.5 is not an industry standard grade but is simply for the purposes of working out the expected emissions using the above linear relationship between cement class and emissions.

# Table 22 — Correction factors to determine the carbon intensity of the production

| Cement class | Expected emissions (tCO2eq/t cementitious product) | Correction factor |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 32.5         | 0.550                                              | 1.18              |
| 42.5         | 0.649                                              | 1.00              |
| 52.5         | 0.748                                              | 0.87              |

The expected emissions of a 48.5 cement is: (48.5 - 42.5) × 0.099 = 0.708tCO2/t cementitious product.

The conversion factor is 0.649/0.708 = 0.92.

The facility’s emissions intensity is 0.416tCO2/t cementitious product.

The corrected emissions intensity is 0.383tCO2/t cement (0.416 × 0.92).

# Hydrogen: Additional information

Methodological notes for Lifecycle Assessment (LCA)

- E7: Compression and purification emission (Energy required to compress and purify hydrogen)
- E8: Transportation emissions to the site where hydrogen will be used (energy and electricity related emissions, and fugitive emissions during transportation)

1 — The lifecycle assessment should follow the latest releases of ISO std (ISO 14040, ISO 14044 for lifecycle assessment, and ISO 14067 for product carbon footprint). The Recommendation 2013/179/EU will be acceptable for assets located in the EU. Results should be verified by an independent third party.

2 — GHG emissions must be estimated for a purity of 99.9% vol, and a gauge pressure of at least 3MPa using correction factors. For pressures higher than 3MPa, additional energy compression emissions must be included as well.

3 — The methodology factor in a Global Warming Potential for a period of 100 years (GWP100) for methane should be 30.

4 — GHG emissions accounting:

E total = E1+E2+E3+E4+E5-E6+E7+E8

to them. Even more rarely addressed is the issue of Just Transition, following the UNFCCC’s definition, understood as transition that enables “transformation of the economy and economic system in a way that is as fair and inclusive as possible to everyone concerned, creating decent work opportunities and leaving no one behind”.122

The global effort to incorporate transition dimension into taxonomies and frameworks does not yet entirely account for assets, such as coal power plants, that pose significant harm to climate objectives, or address the phase-out process. Importantly, in its recent report,123 the EU Platform on Sustainable Finance explicitly recommends developing technical screening criteria for potential decommissioning/closure of assets that do not have technological possibility of transitioning away from significantly harmful performance levels.124 Similarly, GFANZ recommends development of criteria for credible coal phaseout.125

# Context

IEA’s 2021 report indicated that, to be aligned with a 1.5°C scenario, about 100GW of coal-fired plants need to be phased out during 2021-2030, from both developed and emerging economies.121

For coal to green transition the challenge is dual: the focus is not just on scaling-up already zero-emission solutions, but also on how to quickly phase out coal. To date, this phase-out thinking is absent in the green finance discussions despite the vital role it has to play in reducing global emissions.

More countries commit to coal phase-out: at COP26, more than 40 economies from both developed and developing countries and more recently, according to Powering Past Coal Alliance, nearly 50 governments pledged to phase out coal; however, not all are fully aligned with the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, where all OECD countries need to phase out coal by 2030, and the rest of the world by 2040.

…but the phase-out ambition level is often questionable: in many instances, coal retirement pledges refer to plants that operate at or near the end of their full life span, those already sitting idle or long overdue for decommissioning. The challenge is to align the ambition of the 1.5°C objective with an actionable strategy required to fast-track the decommissioning and retirement of the plants that still have a long remaining operational lifetime and remain economically competitive, which could be due to lock in of long-term contracts.

# Innovative climate finance tools

Innovative climate finance tools, often labelled coal transition mechanisms (CTMs), could help to accelerate the coal to green transition: these would allow investors to wind down coal assets and their obligations, whilst placing climate change mitigation and just transition objectives at the heart of the solution.

The demand for CTMs is increasing: CTMs have gained momentum in key coal markets, ranging from securitization transactions in the U.S. to comprehensive coal transition packages such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships that have been launched and implemented in South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam for now. However, these mechanisms are still in the early stages of design; credibility and wide acceptance have yet been established by many financial institutions, agencies, and key stakeholders. There is a need for clear guidance on the credible use of climate finance to support the coal transition in the power sector to build confidence and enable the scalability of these tools.

# Criteria for credible coal transition

Nevertheless, there is no 1.5°C-aligned, science-based classification system that is currently available to define investments eligible as climate finance under coal transition schemes. While green finance classification systems have provided some clarity in other areas, few of the already developed taxonomies or frameworks offer a robust approach towards the coal transition process. In particular, better guidance is required on what acceptable ambition levels for transition of coal assets would be and how to commit.

124Recommendation 10. The Platform recommends developing technical screening criteria for potential ‘decommissioning/closure of…’ Article 19 (3)-type activities, as well as for other activities for which no technological possibility of improving their environmental performance to avoid significant harm exists. It should be noted that whilst respecting The Polluter Pays Principle, it may be possible to add ‘decommissioning of…’ in the next Delegated Act, similar to activities such as ‘renovation of…’ or ‘Renewal of…’. This would provide technical clarity on this topic, albeit indirectly, and could incentivise access to green finance for these activities without changing the Taxonomy Regulation.

# Requirements of the hybrid approach

# Box 1. Estimating fair value of the coal plant and emissions savings

Following the approach devised by the Guidelines for financing a credible coal transition: A framework for assessing the climate and social outcomes of coal transition mechanisms, while comprehensive guidance on the methodologies for estimating fair value of the coal plant (a.ii) and positive absolute emissions savings (a.iii) would offer stakeholders greater clarity on how to ensure alignment with the criteria, both of these requirements are context specific and often still, at this nascent stage of CTM development, require a case by case evaluation, to determine the substantial contribution of a phase-out activity to climate change mitigation objective, it is necessary for criteria to address the following questions:

- Coal plant eligibility/coal asset identification: Is it credible, from climate perspective, to provide transition finance for the given coal plant?
- Coal transition pathways: Does the coal transition pathway proposed by the phase-out process support 1.5°C goals?
- Social protection: Does the transaction include a strategy, plan and provisions to support a just transition? Is the phase-out activity aligned to the Just Transition principles which will address social consequences and look to provide new economic opportunities for affected communities and stakeholders?

“Measuring the fair value of coal assets can be complex. Fair value assessments often incorporate current and future market and regulatory conditions, which can be subject to volatility and speculation. As a result, fair value assessments can be inherently subjective, and each valuation approach brings specific miscalculation risks. Given the benefits and misevaluation risks of different approaches, the appropriate fair value methodology will depend on market and ownership structures, and the quality and availability of financial reporting data.”

“Quantitative emissions savings methodologies are an important area for future work, particularly if CTM transactions will involve results-based carbon finance or generate carbon offsets. Coal plant owners and financial institutions may also wish to provide a quantitative estimate of emissions savings to lend greater transparency to the transaction. Future work could explore whether specific emissions savings thresholds would be appropriate to lend further credibility to transactions.”

To answer these, it is necessary to devise facility level criteria to determine the level of ambition for the phase-out process, and on top of that, the entity and system level criteria that provide necessary safeguards to protect against perverse outcomes.

# Early coal phase-out criteria — the Hybrid approach

The coal-fired power plant can be considered as aligned with this guidance and potentially suitable for a managed coal phase-out process, if it meets the following conditions:

1. all of the facility-level criteria, and
2. all of the entity-level criteria.

# a. Facility-level criteria — the Taxonomy approach

The coal-fired power plant can be considered as aligned with the facility-level criteria if it meets all of the following requirements:

1. The financial close or final investment decision of the coal plant, understood as the point in time at which all the financing agreements have been signed, has been made prior to December 2021.
2. The fair value of the coal plant is positive at the time of the proposed coal transition. The fair value needs to be independently verified or acknowledged by internationally recognised bodies or programmes.
3. The early coal phase-out results in positive absolute emissions savings over the expected total lifetime of the coal plant compared with a case without it. The emissions savings need to be independently verified or acknowledged by internationally recognised bodies or programmes.
4. The phase-out of unabated coal combustion at the coal plant is aligned with, or happens earlier than 1.5°C-aligned coal phase-out deadlines. In advanced economies, this means the coal plant retires at the latest by 2030, and in other countries by 2040, in line with the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero pathway. Should a country have a national coal phase-out target that is earlier, national targets should be adhered to instead.

CTMs and frameworks governing early coal phase-out processes are in the nascent stage of development. Acknowledging limitations of the proposed criteria, the document will need to be revised on a regular basis as more bodies of work become available.

Proposed facility and entity level criteria are thus to be valid for a limited period of time – until 2027. After 2027, a new, revised criteria accounting for new developments in the field should replace the current document. Early coal phase-out criteria will be phased out by 2035. Beyond 2030 they will be applicable only for the early phase-out of CFPPs in emerging economies.

# Figure 18 — Overview of requirements focused on coal plant’s generation replacement.

If the requirement a.vii cannot be met (regardless of whether for reasons related to facility/entity plans or grid and energy system capacities and/or planning (e.g. overcapacity)) and the coal plant is retired and not replaced with a portfolio of clean resources that provides equivalent electricity services, then entity and system level requirement b. iv. has to be met. All other facility, entity and system level requirements have to be met.

# Requirement a.vii

Will the coal plant be retired and replaced with a portfolio of clean resources that provides equivalent electricity services?

| Yes | No |
| --- | -- |

# Requirement viii

The coal plant, at a facility level as a minimum, has a just transition plan either as a separate document or as an element embedded into the Transition Plan (requirement b.iii) to mitigate impacts on key stakeholders including workers, electricity customers, and the local community. The just transition plan is designed in line with global decarbonisation commitments and, in regulated markets, planning.

Just transition plan should, inter alia, require the facility owner to:

1. Provide advance notice, of at least six months, or according to local laws and regulations whichever is earlier, of coal plant closure and communicate clear timelines for phase-out,
2. Engage in stakeholder consultations and dialogues,
3. Commit to conduct environmental and social impact assessments of the coal plant closure on its workers, direct supply chain workers, communities and ecosystem,
4. Report on and develop plans to minimise adverse impacts on communities,
5. Develop a worker transition plan that would support relief and reskilling opportunities to affected workers,
6. Consider energy affordability and accessibility aspects of the early coal phase-out,
7. Conduct remediation and reclamation.

# Entity and system level criteria — the Transition Planning approach

The coal-fired power plant can be considered as aligned with the entity- and system-level criteria if it meets all of the following requirements:

# Entity-level criteria:

Entity level criteria apply to all actors who have shares in the given coal plant, who are planning purchase of such shares or who had such shares, which they sold, but prior to the sale benefited in any extent from the early coal phase-out scheme. New owners of the coal plant, that is a beneficiary of the early coal phase-out process, need to be aligned with the entity-level criteria and commit to maintaining compliance of the facility with the facility-level criteria.

1. The coal plant owner has an entity-level commitment to no new abated and unabated coal power plant development or procurement globally, beyond their plants that have reached financial close or final investment decision by December 2021 (as per a.i.).
2. The coal plant owner has an entity-level commitment not to establish new or extend existing fossil-fuel based Power Purchase Agreements beyond these that have been signed by December 2023.
3. The entity has a Paris Agreement (PA)-aligned transition plan that follows the principles of transition finance outlined by International Platform on Sustainable Finance. The transition plan needs to be independently verified or acknowledged by internationally recognised bodies.

Refers to both abated and unabated coal combustion – all operations of the coal-fired power plant. Integrated utilities could also be expected to assess and report on impacts to ratepayers, including any distributional or energy access impacts.

The replacement generation need not be developed by the existing coal plant owner but could be done through a partnership with another company or the government.

Recognised bodies or programmes. Acknowledging that this may pose to be a challenge for many of the entities that are in the transition process, it is not expected for the entities to be PA aligned today, but to develop a plan on how to be aligned with that target.

The alignment needs to happen by 2030 at the latest.

# Power-system-level criteria:

iv. If the coal plant is retired and not replaced with a portfolio of clean resources that provides equivalent electricity services (see facility-level requirement a.vii), at least one of the following requirements set at the power system level has to be met:

1. Requirement 1: 1.5°C-aligned, science-based power-sector-level decarbonisation commitments and plans at a national or sub-national level – with a boundary entailing the entire power system in which the entity operates139. While these commitments would not necessarily be expected to be fully aligned with 1.5°C to receive support from a CTM today, such a commitment would support a ratcheting process to achieve 1.5°C ambition over time and by 2030 the latest.
2. Requirement 2: Consists of the following set of power-system-level commitments that all have to be met to prove the alignment with criteria. Commitments will be at a national or sub-national level — with a boundary entailing the entire power system in which the entity operates.
1. Commitment to no new abated and unabated coal power plant development or procurement globally, beyond the plants that have reached financial close or final investment decision by October 2023, and
2. Commitment to not establish new or extend existing Power Purchase Agreements with power plants that do not meet Green criteria for the Taxonomy beyond these that have been signed by October 2023, and
3. Commitment not to increase international imports of power beyond the levels recorded by October 2023, from grids that have energy intensity higher than existing grid.

Requirement 2 is only applicable until 2030 and will not be extended beyond the current version of criteria.
